Duke BME is deeply engaged in improving human and population health

A hallmark of our approach is extensive collaborations with leading physicians
and scientists at Duke’s School of Medicine.

### Center for Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering (CBTE)

CBTE emphasizes research, education and interactions with industry—applying
principles and experimental methods of engineering to develop solutions to
practical and fundamental problems.

### Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics (FIP)

FIP trains the commercial, technical and academic leaders of next generation
broadband technologies, pioneers photonics as an information science, and
pioneers new approaches to industrial, governmental and interacademy
collaboration. Research themes include quantum optics, opto-electronics,
information spaces, and biophotonics.
