Coursework

    

The program of coursework, including the applicability of any transfer
credits, is determined by the student, their advisor, and their committee. The
minimum required amount of coursework is 30 units.

The advanced math (3 units required) and life science (3 units required)
courses and up to one (1) independent study class may be used toward this
requirement. See Duke BME's list of potential life science and advanced math
courses; however, students are not limited solely to these courses.

Ungraded seminars _do not_ count toward the 30-unit requirement. Students are
encouraged to discuss class selection with their advisor upon matriculation
and frequently throughout their course of study.

Each committee meeting should include an update on progress towards coursework
requirements. The student’s committee retains the power to approve the
coursework or request that the student take additional courses. Note: students
seeking a master’s degree en route to a PhD must satisfy the degree
requirements for the master’s degree. These are not necessarily aligned with
the PhD coursework requirements, and so special consideration should be taken.

Seminars

    

Two semesters of BME Seminar are required. New matriculants take BME 702s
(Fall only). Second-year students take BME 701s (Spring only).

Teaching Assistantship (TA)

    

Two (2) semesters are required. Students typically fulfill their Teaching
Assistant (TA) assignments in years 2–5. Students must sign up for the TA
seminar during the semester in which they TA, and they must also complete a
Pratt School of Engineering TA training session.

Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)

    

RCR training at Duke challenges students to engage in ethical decision-making
through active learning—by using realistic scenarios and current issues.

One (1) orientation session and 4 forums are required. More details »
