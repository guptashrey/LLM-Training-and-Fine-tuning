Graduates of doctoral programs in Biomedical Engineering are increasingly
interested in entrepreneurship as a career path.

Duke’s Entrepreneurial Postdoctoral Program in Biomedical Engineering
addresses the emerging need to equip participants with the skills needed to
start technology-based companies based on their research.

For selected applicants, the program provides one year of salary support
through the first year of their new venture. In addition, it provides hands-on
mentoring and coaching from a group of entrepreneurial advisors based both
within Duke University as well as those engaged within the broader Duke
community.

As a condition of entry into the program, candidates will agree to engage in
the following activities:

  3. Pitch Deck Preparation – Participants will prepare and deliver a company pitch deck and supporting materials. In-depth coaching from a variety of resources within Duke will be made available to help build a detailed business plan and pitch deck.

  4. Company Formation - With support from their Entrepreneurial Advising Team, participants will learn about the steps required to create their company.
