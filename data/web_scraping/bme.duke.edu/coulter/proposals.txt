## Schedule

### December/January

Potential applicants are encouraged to submit a brief summary (less than one
page) of the research project, clinical need being addressed, knowledge of IP
landscape, potential users of the technology, etc.

The goal of submitting the summary is to strengthen proposals by initiating
discussion and action with Coulter Project Team and Duke Office of Licensing &
Ventures, in addition to experts outside Duke to assess the idea and provide
feedback related to market and IP.

### February

Potential applicants meet with CPD team for advice and guidance on project
idea and development of a strong proposal.

### March

Faculty submit proposal(s), along with a rough budget with approximate
salaries and expected supply expenses. Full budgets with departmental
approvals will be obtained in time for projects that are recommended for
funding. Oversight Committee & Coulter Project Team will then review and
discuss submitted proposals.

### May/June

Potential applicant pool is approximately cut in half. Strongest applicants
are invited to present their project before the Oversight Committee for oral
presentation.

### June

Awardees are contacted; complete budgets are prepared and submitted.

### July

Budgets are reviewed, corrected and signed off. ****

### July – August

1\. Assignment of Project Managers to projects

2\. Kickoff meetings with Project Managers and Barry Myers

### August 31

All prior award fund codes are closed.

### September 1

New fund codes are opened and the first quarter begins.

## Post-Award

The Coulter Program Director and staff assist in preparing grants (i.e., STTR
grants and NC Innovative Development for Economic Advancement Awards)

The Coulter team’s relationship with the Office of Licenses and Ventures helps
to move projects closer to clinical application.
