# Duke-Coulter Translational Partnership

Accelerating development of promising bioengineering research

Since 2006, Duke's translational partnership with the Wallace H. Coulter
Foundation has supported collaborative research projects that address unmet
clinical needs and lead to improvements in health care and to commercial
products.

> The Duke-Coulter Partnership has awarded **more than $12 million** to more
> than 60 projects
>
> MORE DATA »

## Connecting Engineering and Medicine

At Duke, each partnership award supports collaborative translational research
projects that involve co-investigators from:

  * Duke Biomedical Engineering, and
  * Clinical departments of Duke Health

Each year, we typically award three to five grants and have about $700,000 per
year for awards. Award amounts vary based upon amount requested and budget
evaluation of the Oversight Committee.

Since our founding in 2005, more than $11 million has been awarded to more
than 60 projects.

* * *

## SELECTION and Evaluation CRITERIA

Each year, we have a call for proposals.

### Each Proposal Must Have

  * At least one individual whose primary or secondary faculty appointment is
    within Duke BME, and at least one clinical investigator
  * Research that directly relates to applications in health care
  * An objective that includes an outcome that will benefit patients

### Each Proposal is Evaluated On

  * Scientific merit
  * Potential health care impact and significance
  * The experience of the investigators
  * Potential for commercialization or translation to patient care
  * Potential for successfully obtaining further support

## About Duke-Coulter

Coulter

 **Wallace H. Coulter** (1913–1998) is recognized as one of the most
influential inventors of the 20th century.

He was an electrical engineer and businessman whose invention of the Coulter
Counter made possible the complete blood count, one of medicine's most-
requested and informative diagnostic tests.

In 2005, Duke BME was one of nine biomedical engineering programs to receive
partnership awards from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation. The partnership
grants about $700,000 per year for awards.
