Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

My research focuses on the application of optical technologies for non-
invasive, high-resolution imaging of biological tissues. In particular, our
laboratory develops optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser
ophthalmoscopy (SLO), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and other optical
imaging technologies for applications in the diagnosis and treatment of
disease, particularly diseases of the eye. My work focuses not only on the
engineering and technical development of novel imaging technologies, but also
the preparation of these technologies for commercialization through clinical
validation and regulatory approval.
