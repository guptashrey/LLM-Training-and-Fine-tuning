Adjunct Associate Professor of Neurobiology

My laboratory studies how the retina processes visual scenes and transmits
this information to the brain. We use multi-electrode arrays to record the
activity of hundreds of retina neurons simultaneously in conjunction with
transgenic mouse lines and chemogenetics to manipulate neural circuit
function. We are interested in three major areas. First, we work to understand
how neurons in the retina are functionally connected. Second we are studying
how light-adaptation and circadian rhythms alter visual processing in the
retina. Finally, we are working to understand the mechanisms of retinal
degenerative conditions and we are investigating potential treatments in
animal models.
