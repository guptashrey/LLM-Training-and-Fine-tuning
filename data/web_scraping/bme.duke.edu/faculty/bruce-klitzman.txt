Associate Research Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Our overriding interests are in the fields of tissue engineering, wound
healing, biosensors, and long term improvement of medical device implantation.
My basic research interests are in the area of physiological mechanisms of
optimizing substrate transport to tissue. This broad topic covers studies on a
whole animal, whole organ, hemorheological, microvascular, cellular,
ultrastructural, and molecular level. The current projects include:  
1) control of blood flow and flow distribution in the microcirculation,  
2) the effects of long-term synthetic and biologic implants on substrate
transport to tissues,  
3) tissue engineering; combining isolated cells, especially adult stem cells,
with biomaterials to form specialized composite structures for implantation,
with particular emphasis on endothelial cell physiology and its alteration by
isolation and seeding on biomaterials.  
4) decreasing the thrombogenicity of synthetic blood vessels and other blood-
contacting devices, and improving their overall performance and
biocompatibility.  
5) reducing tissue damage resulting from abnormal perfusion (e.g., relative
ischemia, anoxia, etc.) and therapies which minimize ischemic damage.  
6) biosensor function, particularly glucose sensors in normal and diabetics.  
7) measurement of tissue blood flow and oxygenation as an indicator of tissue
viability and functional potential.  
8) development of biocompatible materials for soft tissue reconstruction or
augmentation.  
9) improving performance of glaucoma drainage devices by directing a more
favorable foreign body reaction  
10) wound healing; particularly internal healing around foreign materials and
the effect and prevention of microbes around implanted devices.
