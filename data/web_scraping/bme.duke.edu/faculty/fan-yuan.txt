Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Dr. Yuan has extensive experiences in analysis of therapeutic agent transport
in mammalian cells, tissues, and organs, and development of effective
strategies, design principles, and new technologies that can be used to
facilitate the transport. The goal of his research is to improve delivery of
therapeutic agents to their targets, which is crucial in treatment and
prevention of diseases. He has published >100 scientific papers in peer-
reviewed journals, and a textbook on transport analysis in biological systems
that has been used to teach undergraduate and graduate courses in many
universities.
