# Samira Musah

  2. Faculty

Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

The Musah Lab is interested in understanding how molecular signals and
biophysical forces can function either synergistically or independently to
guide organ development and physiology, and how these processes can be
therapeutically harnessed to treat human disease. Given the escalating medical
crisis in nephrology as growing number of patients suffer from kidney disease
that can lead to organ failure, the Musah Lab focuses on engineering stem cell
fate for applications in human kidney disease, extra-renal complications, and
therapeutic development. Dr. Musah’s research interests include stem cell
biology and regenerative medicine, molecular and cellular basis of human organ
development and disease progression, organ engineering, patient-specific
disease models, biomarker identification, therapeutic discovery, tissue and
organ transplantation, microphysiological systems including Organ Chips
(organs-on-chips) and organoids, matrix biology, mechanotransduction and
disease biophysics.
