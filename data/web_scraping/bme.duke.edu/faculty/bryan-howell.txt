Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

My lab studies implantable and wearable devices for treating neurological
impairment, namely with deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial
electrical stimulation (tES). Projects evolve through theoretical and
preclinical stages of development, combining biophysical and dynamic causal
modeling, medical imaging, and device prototyping, to test new concepts and
strategies for these neurotechnologies. Noninvasive studies on tES are
conducted in tissue phantoms and healthy human subjects in-house, and we
collaborate with physicians to test new concepts in clinical populations.

## Appointments and Affiliations

  * Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

## Education

  * Ph.D. Duke University, 2015

## Research Interests

  * Biophysical deconstruction of evoked potentials to subcallosal and
    subthalamic DBS.
  * Predictive modeling of DBS for targeting and parameter optimization.
  * Combinatorial and interferential strategies for tES.
  * Personalized, home-based administration of tES.
