Assistant Professor of Neurobiology

We study neural coding and computation from a theoretical perspective with
particular emphasis on probabilistic reasoning and decision making under
uncertainty, complex behavioral modeling, computational models of cortical
circuits and circuit function, dynamics of spiking neural networks, and
statistical analysis of neural and behavioral data. Previous work has been
largely concerned with sensory-motor transformations and neural
representations of complex stimuli such as odors. More recently, we have been
focusing on developing non-linear latent state space models of neural networks
as standard linear models are incapable of generating even very simple
behaviors.
