Associate Professor in Radiology

I have a joint appointment in Radiology and Neurology and my research focuses
on neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. I work on imaging and
analysis to provide a comprehensive characterization of the brain. MRI is
particularly suitable for brain imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging is an
important tool for studying brain microstructure, and the connectivity amongst
gray matter regions.  
  
I am interested in image segmentation, morphometry and shape analysis, as well
as in integrating information from MRI with genetics, and behavior. Our
approaches target: 1) phenotyping the neuroanatomy using imaging; 2)
uncovering the link between structural and functional changes, the genetic
bases, and environmental factors. I am interested in generating methods and
tools for comprehensive phenotyping.  
  
We use high-performance cluster computing to accelerate our image analysis. We
use compressed sensing image reconstruction, and process large image arrays
using deformable registration, perform segmentation based on multiple image
contrasts including diffusion tensor imaging, as well as voxel, and graph
analysis for connectomics.  
  
At BIAC my efforts focus on developing multivariate biomarkers and identifying
vulnerable networks based on genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.  
  
My enthusiasm comes from the possibility to extend from single to integrative
multivariate and network based analyses to obtain a comprehensive picture of
normal development and aging, stages of disease, and the effects of
treatments. I am working on multivariate image analysis and predictive
modeling approaches to help better understand early biomarkers for human
disease indirectly through mouse models, as well as directly in human studies.  
  
I am dedicated to supporting an increase in female presence in STEM fields,
and love working with students. The Bass Connections teams involve
undergraduate students in research, providing them the opportunity to do
independent research studies and get involved with the community. These
students have for example takes classes such as:  
  
BME 394: Projects in Biomedical Engineering (GE)  
BME 493: Projects in Biomedical Engineering (GE)  
ECE 899: Special Readings in Electrical Engineering  
NEUROSCI 493: Research Independent Study 1
