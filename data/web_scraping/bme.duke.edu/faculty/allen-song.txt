Professor in Radiology

The research in our lab is concerned with advancing structural and functional
MRI methodologies (e.g. fast and high-resolution imaging techniques) for human
brain imaging. We also aim to improve our understanding of functional brain
signals, including spatiotemporal characterizations of the blood oxygenation
level dependent contrast and alternative contrast mechanisms that are more
directly linked to the neuronal activities. Additional effort is invested in
applying and validating the developed methods to study human functional
neuroanatomy.
