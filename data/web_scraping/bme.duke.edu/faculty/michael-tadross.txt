Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Dr. Tadross' lab develops technologies to rapidly deliver drugs to genetically
defined subsets of cells in the brain. By using these reagents in mouse models
of neuropsychiatric disease, his group is mapping how specific receptors on
defined cells and synapses in the brain give rise to diverse neural
computations and behaviors. The approach leverages drugs currently in use to
treat human neuropsychiatric disease, facilitating clinically relevant
interpretation of the mapping effort.  
  
He received his B.S. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Rutgers
University, an M.D.-Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine, and completed his postdoctoral study in Cellular
Neuroscience at Stanford University. He began his independent research program
as a fellow at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus.

## Research Interests

Our goal is to bridge the gap between the study of brain as a computational
device and the search for novel neuropathological treatments. We develop
technologies to manipulate molecules, cells, and synapses in the brain, and
deploy these reagents in mouse models of disease.
