Professor in Radiology

My research uses computer vision and machine learning to improve medical
imaging, focusing on breast and CT imaging. There are three specific projects:

(1) We design deep learning models to diagnose breast cancer from mammograms.
We perform single-shot lesion detection, multi-task
segmentation/classification, and image synthesis. Our goal is to improve
radiologist diagnostic performance and empower patients to make personalized
treatment decisions. This work is funded by NIH, Dept of Defense, Cancer
Research UK, and other agencies.

(2) We create "digital twin" anatomical models that are based on actual
patient data and thus contain highly realistic anatomy. With customized 3D
printing, these virtual phantoms can also be rendered into physical form to be
scanned on actual imaging devices, which allows us to assess image quality in
new ways that are clinically relevant.

(3) We are building a computer-aided triage platform to classify multiple
diseases across multiple organs in chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans. Our
hospital-scale data sets have hundreds of thousands of patients. This work
includes natural language processing to analyze radiology reports as well as
deep learning models for organ segmentation and disease classification.
