Michael J. Fitzpatrick Distinguished Professor of Engineering

My research centers on the development and application of cutting-edge optical
technologies for non-invasive, high-resolution imaging and sensing in living
biological tissues. Our laboratory is recognized for foundational
contributions to optical coherence-based approaches for in vivo sub-surface
microscopic tissue imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT)
which has become a standard of care in ophthalmology and other clinical
specialties. The technologies we employ include adaptive-optic devices,
femtosecond lasers, ultrabroadband fiber optic telecommunications equipment,
robots and robotic manipulators, high performance computing, and 3D display
technologies. Together with our collaborators, we have developed and deployed
multiple hand-held and intrasurgical systems for real-time volumetric imaging
of the human eye, visualized using virtual/augmented reality displays and
coupled to image-guided robotic microsurgical procedures. Our research team
includes a rich and diverse group of highly motivated and productive
undergraduate, MS and PhD students, staff and associated faculty along with
multiple collaborations with engineers, biologists, and physicians at Duke and
elsewhere.
