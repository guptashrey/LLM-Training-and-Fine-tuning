Robert Plonsey Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

My laboratory develops and evaluates novel ultrasonic imaging methods. Current
projects involve high resolutioon imaging of the breast and mechanical
characterization of the breast and cardiovascular system. We conduct phantom,
animal, ex vivo and in vivo trials. Current clinical trials involve imaging of
soft and hard vascular plaques and mecahnical imaging of breast lesions.
