Charles E. Putman University Distinguished Professor of Radiology

Dr. Johnson is the Charles E. Putman University Professor of Radiology,
Professor of Physics, and Biomedical Engineering, and Director of the Duke
Center for In Vivo Microscopy (CIVM). The CIVM is an NIH/NIBIB national
Biomedical Technology Resource Center with a mission to develop novel
technologies for preclinical imaging (basic sciences) and apply the
technologies to critical biomedical questions. Dr. Johnson was one of the
first researchers to bring Paul Lauterbur's vision of magnetic resonance (MR)
microscopy to practice as described in his paper, "Nuclear magnetic resonance
imaging at microscopic resolution" (J Magn Reson 68:129-137, 1986). Dr.
Johnson is involved in both the engineering physics required to extend the
resolution of MR imaging and in a broad range of applications in the basic
sciences.
