Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Dr. Wax's research interests include optical spectroscopy for early cancer
detection, novel microscopy and interferometry techniques.

The study of intact, living cells with optical spectroscopy offers the
opportunity to observe cellular structure, organization and dynamics in a way
that is not possible with traditional methods. We have developed a set of
novel spectroscopic techniques for measuring spatial, temporal and refractive
structure on sub-hertz and sub-wavelength scales based on using low-coherence
interferometry (LCI) to detect scattered light. We have applied these
techniques in different types of cell biology experiments. In one experiment,
LCI measurements of the angular pattern of backscattered light are used to
determine non-invasively the structure of sub-cellular organelles in cell
monolayers, and the components of epithelial tissue from freshly excised rat
esophagus. This work has potential as a diagnostic method for early cancer
detection. In another experiment, LCI phase measurements are used to examine
volume changes of epithelial cells in a monolayer in response to environmental
osmolarity changes. Although cell volume changes have been measured
previously, this work demonstrates for the first time the volume of just a few
cells (2 or 3) tracked continuously and in situ.
