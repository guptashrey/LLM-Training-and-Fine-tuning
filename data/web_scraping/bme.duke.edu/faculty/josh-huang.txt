Duke School of Medicine Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience

We study the development and function of cortical circuits underlying motor
control and cognitive processing. Our research program integrates multi-
faceted approaches from genetic engineering to single-cell genomics,
developmental neurobiology, imaging, electrophysiology, and behavioral
analyses, and aims to link fundamental neuroscience to the understanding and
treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.
