Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering

The Reker lab tightly integrates biomedical data science and wet-lab
experiments for the analysis and design of therapeutic opportunities.
Automated experimentation can be guided by active machine learning to generate
knowledge-rich datasets. A key aspect of our research is improving our
understanding of the most effective active machine learning workflows to
enable the broad deployment of adaptive machine learning and automated
experimentation.

We focus our adaptive model development on critical drug properties such as
efficacy, biodistribution, metabolism, toxicity, and side-effects. Prospective
applications of these predictions enable us to better understand limitations
of currently approved medications as well as design new drug candidates,
nanoparticles, and pharmaceutical formulations. By integrating clinical data
analysis, we can rapidly validate the translational relevance of our
predictions and conceive big data-driven protocols for precision medicine and
personalized drug delivery.
