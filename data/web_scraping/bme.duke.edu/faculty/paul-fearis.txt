Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering

Paul Fearis joined Duke after 28 years in the medical device design consulting
industry with PDD, Sagentia and latterly his own consultancy Clinvue.  
  
Originally trained in Industrial Design Engineering at the Royal College of
Art and in Mechanical Design at Cranfield Institute of Technology in the
United Kingdom, Paul helped to define and bring to market a broad range of
medical devices for both multinational corporations and startups in the United
States and around the world.

Paul specializes in human-centric product design with particular emphasis on
front-end innovation and product specification processes, including
ethnographic observational research and the identification of unmet,
underserved and unarticulated clinical/stakeholder needs.
