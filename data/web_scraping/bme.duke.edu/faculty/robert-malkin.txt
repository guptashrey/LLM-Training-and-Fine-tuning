Professor of Practice Emeritus in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

Professor Malkin is interested in medical instrumentation in the developing
world.

Dr. Malkin is also the founder of Engineering World Health and the Global
Public Service Academies. These unique study abroad programs allow
undergraduates (EWH) and high school students (GPSA) to study and work in
developing world healthcare settings.  
  
Dr. Malkin also conducts research and development focused on medical equipment
in the developing world.  
  
Professor Malkin's work on medical instrumentation in the developing world has
been supported by Engineering World Health, The National Institutes of Health,
The American Heart Association, The Whitaker Foundation, the National Science
Foundation and other organizations.  
  
The DHT-Lab runs educational programs such as the EWH Summer Institute and
formal classes and provides research and product development opportunities for
undergraduates interested in developing world healthcare technology.

Engineering World Health Summer Institute is a unique study abroad program
that allows undergraduates to study and work in developing world hospitals.
Dr. Malkin and his associates have helped hospitals in Sudan, Nigeria,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Liberia, Sierra Leone and many other places. If
you came to this site looking for high school programs, consider visiting the
Global Public Service Academies a non-Duke program run by Dr. Malkin.
