Joseph W. and Dorothy W. Beard Distinguished Professor of Experimental Surgery

The main focus of my translational research laboratory is to develop RNA based
therapeutic agents for the potential treatment of a range of diseases. To this
end, we have and will continue to take advantage of the fact that RNA is not
just a passive carrier of genetic instructions inside of cells during the
conversion of information from DNA to RNA to protein. Rather, RNA is an
extremely versatile biological macromolecule. Certian RNAs can bind to
specific protiens with high affinities, while others can for catalytic centers
and perform enzymatic reactions. These facets of RNA coupled with the ease
with which RNA can be manipulated in vitro make it a very powerful and unique
therapeutic agent whose potential is largely untapped. Durring our endeavors,
we plan to work closely with the members of the Molecular Therapeutics program
as well as other faculty at the Duke University Medical Center to expedite the
development and testing of these therapeutics.  
  
The specific aims of my laboratory are:  
  
1\. To isolate and characterize RNA and DNA aptamers which block
therapeutically relavent proteins such as those involved in cardiovascular
diseases and immune modulation.  
  
2\. To develop RNA-based tumor targeting strategies for delivering siRNAs and
miRNAs to tumor cells.  
  
3\. To reprogram cells using mRNA delivery.  
  
4\. To explore novel methods to control inflammation.
