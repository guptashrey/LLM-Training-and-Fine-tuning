Edmund T. Pratt, Jr. School Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Our research employs engineering approaches to understand and control neural
function. We work on fundamental questions and applied development in
electrical stimulation of the nervous system to restore function to
individuals with neurological impairment or injury.

Current projects include:  
• understanding the mechanisms of and developing advanced approaches to deep
brain stimulation to treat movement disorders,  
• developing novel approaches to peripheral nerve electrical stimulation for
restoration of bladder function,  
• understanding the mechanisms of and developing advanced approaches to spinal
cord stimulation to treat chronic pain,  
• understanding and controlling the cellular effects of transcranial magnetic
stimulation, and  
• design of novel electrodes and waveforms for selective stimulation of the
nervous system.
