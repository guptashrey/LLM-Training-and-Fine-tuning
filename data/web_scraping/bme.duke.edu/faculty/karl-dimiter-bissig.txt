Chen Family Associate Professor of Pediatrics

Our group is interested in diseases of the liver, ranging from viral hepatitis
to metabolic liver disorders and liver cancer. The lab specializes in human
liver chimeric mice and created the first xenograft model for metabolic liver
disease as well as a novel patient derived cancer model. We use these next
generation humanized mouse models to develop new therapeutic approaches, such
as metabolic pathway reprogramming - a CRISPR based gene therapy approach.
