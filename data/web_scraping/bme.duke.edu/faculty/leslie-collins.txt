Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Leslie M. Collins earned the BSEE degree from the University of Kentucky, and
the MSEE, and PhD degrees from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From
1986 through 1990 she was a Senior Engineer at Westinghouse Research and
Development Center in Pittsburgh, PA. She joined Duke in 1995 as an Assistant
Professor and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2002 and to Professor in
2007. Her research interests include physics-based statistical signal
processing, subsurface sensing, auditory prostheses and pattern recognition.
She is a member of the Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Eta Kappa Nu honor
societies. Dr. Collins has been a member of the team formed to transition
MURI-developed algorithms and hardware to the Army HSTAMIDS and GSTAMIDS
landmine detection systems. She has been the principal investigator on
research projects from ARO, NVESD, SERDP, ESTCP, NSF, and NIH. Dr. Collins was
the PI on the DoD UXO Cleanup Project of the Year in 2000. As of 2015, Dr.
Collins has graduated 15 PhD students.
