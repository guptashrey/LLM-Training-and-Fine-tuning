Adjunct Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Dr. Nightingale's research interests include:

  * biomechanical investigations of cervical spine trauma,
  * the biomechanics of brain injury
  * development of cervical spine injury criteria, tensile responses and
    tensile tolerance of the cervical spine,
  * development of computational models (finite element and multi-body
    dynamics) of cervical spine impact,
  * factors influencing injury in airbag deployments,
  * pediatric airbag injuries and injury mechanisms,
  * factors influencing dynamic buckling of segmented structures subjected to
    impact loads,
  * the 3-D stability of intact and injured spinal motion segments,
  * evaluation of the performance of intrapedicular spinal instrumentation,
  * evaluation of titanium wire implants for posterior lumbar interbody
    fusion,
  * evaluation of the protective ability of soccer shin-guards, and
  * Accoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging
