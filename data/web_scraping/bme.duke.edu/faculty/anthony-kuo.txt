Associate Professor of Ophthalmology

Anthony Kuo, MD is an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and Assistant
Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. He is a clinician-
scientist with an active clinical practice in cornea and refractive surgery
and an active laboratory program developing and translating high resolution
optical coherence tomography (OCT) technologies for ophthalmic use.  
  
With collaborators at Duke, he is also involved in the development and
translation of intra-surgical OCT technologies. His research has been
sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, Research to Prevent Blindness,
the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Coulter Foundation among others.
