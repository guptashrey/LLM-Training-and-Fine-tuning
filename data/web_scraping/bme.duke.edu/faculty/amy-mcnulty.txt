Associate Professor in Orthopaedic Surgery

The McNulty Lab is working to develop strategies to prevent osteoarthritis and
to promote tissue repair and regeneration following joint injury. In order to
accomplish this, we are working in three main areas. 1) We are working to
understand the pathways that are activated by normal and injurious mechanical
loading of cartilage and meniscus and how these mechanotransduction pathways
are altered during aging, injury, and tissue degeneration. A greater
understanding of alterations in mechanosensitive signaling mechanisms with
aging and injury will likely reveal potential targets to promote tissue repair
and prevent tissue degeneration and osteoarthritis development. 2) We are
developing meniscus tissue engineered constructs that will be utilized to
repair and replace meniscus tissue lost due to injury and surgical resection.
3) We are focusing on the biological and biomechanical changes that occur in
the joint following meniscus injury and how these may contribute to
osteoarthritis development.
