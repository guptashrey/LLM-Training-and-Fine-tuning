Giving biomedical engineers a competitive edge in industry and academia

Biomedical engineering has become a prime discipline for applying data science
techniques—and the job market for biomedical engineers with data science
skills is expanding rapidly.

With its pioneering expertise and leadership in biomedical engineering,
machine learning, signal and image processing, and biostatistics, Duke is the
ideal place to learn how to translate biomedical data into actionable health
insights.

By collaborating with and learning from leading researchers, students who earn
a Biomedical Data Science Certificate can increase their competitiveness for
positions in industry and doctoral programs.

Enrollment in the four-course Master's Certificate in Biomedical Data Science
is open to all Duke Master of Engineering (MEng) and Master of Science (MS)
students intending to pursue careers or enter doctoral programs relating to
biomedical data science.
