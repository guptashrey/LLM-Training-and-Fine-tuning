Funding Opportunities

    

Because many see the Master of Engineering (MEng) as a professional degree,
most students pay their own tuition costs. Many students use student loans and
believe there will be an excellent return on investment.

In certain circumstances, we provide limited financial aid to MEng students.

#### Diversity Scholarships

Limited financial aid is available to highly qualified candidates through
academic scholarships with an emphasis on increasing diversity within our
master's degree programs.

Underrepresented minorities may receive up to 50 percent per year in tuition
scholarship through our Diversity Scholarships. Additionally, up to $10,000
per year may be allocated for the student to gain experience in a research
setting under the direction of a principal investigator (PI).

#### Externally Funded Scholarships

We also offer support to recipients of some competitively externally funded
scholarships, such as

  * National Science Foundation (NSF) Fellowships
  * Fulbright Scholar Program

#### On-Campus Work

While enrolled in the program, many students work in a variety of places, such
as campus libraries and various departments within Duke University. Teaching
assistantships and grader jobs are available in various departments.

These positions are paid an hourly rate, and most students work between 10 to
20 hours per week. Positions are generally posted and filled before classes
begin each semester.

#### External Funding Opportunities

Browse our extensive list of potential external funding opportunities on our
dedicated website for MEng students.
