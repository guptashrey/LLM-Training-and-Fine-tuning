An intensive design program for BME students

The Biomedical Engineering Fellows is an intensive design program for BME
students interested in pursuing careers in medical technology that will
provide them with practical design experience.

## Academics

The courses in this program will allow students to become comfortable with
performing electronic and mchanical computer aided design (CAD), printed
circuit board (PCB) layout and fabrication, and electronic signal processing
in hardware and with microcontrollers. Each student will design, construct and
demonstrate a functional medical instrument based on a clinical need
identified by a Duke University Medical Center clinician, and their device
will be tested and iterated on through low-medium-high fidelity prototyping.
Students will also be exposed to the FDA medical device clearance process.

The program involves the following courses:

  * Freshman Design (EGR101) [required for all Pratt students]
  * Medtech Device Prototyping Skills (BME290L) [recommended sophomore or
    junior year, counts as general BME elective]
    * CAD
    * 3D printing
    * ECAD (schematic capture, PCB layout & fabrication)
    * Analog & digital circuit design; microcontrollers
    * Electronics specification testing
    * Agile Project Management / Kanban Boards
  * Medical Device Design I (BME 473L) [senior fall, can count as BME general
    elevtice or IM advanced elective]
  * Medical Device Design II (BME474L) [senior spring, counts as BME design
    requirement]
  * Advanced Design Elective
    * Medical Software Design (BME547, can count as BME general elective or IM advanced elective)
    * Quality Systems for BME (BME590) [prereq: BME474L]
    * Advanced Design & Manufacturing (BME590L) [prereq: BME474L]
    * Medical Product Reimbursement (BME590L)
    * Design Project Independent Study (requires pre-approval)

## Industry and Medical Center Opportunities

Students who participate in this program frequently engage in summer
internships with biomedical engineering companies, both inside and outside
Research Triangle Part (RTP), including:

  * Blur
  * Garmin
  * Stryker
  * InnAVasc (now Gore)
  * Edwards Lifesciences
  * MicroElastic Ultrasound
  * Zimmer Biomet
  * Pilleve
  * LivaNova
  * Boundless Science

Students have had opportunities to design medical devices in various
departments within Duke University Hospital, including:

  * Duke University School of Nursing
  * Duke Surgery
  * Duke Gastroenterology
  * Duke Urology
  * Duke Neurology
  * Duke Pediatrics
