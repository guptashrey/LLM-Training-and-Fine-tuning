  2. Undergraduate

Duke Biomedical Engineering (BME) students learn the classical engineering
disciplines, as well as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. They
also gain broad exposure to Duke's excellent offerings in the social sciences
and humanities.

In addition to engineering courses, our curriculum includes:

  * General Advising Procedures »

  * Five social science and humanities courses
  * One undergraduate writing course
  * Two introductory courses each in physics and chemistry
  * Two life-science courses
  * Five mathematics courses
  * One computational methods course

To add depth, focus and career preparation to their studies, Duke BME
undergraduates may also pursue elective-course sequences, double-majors,
second majors, minors and certificates. Learn more »

## Double Majors, Minors and Specializations

To add depth, focus and career preparation to their Duke BME degrees, our
students may also pursue:

### Elective-Course Sequences

Students may choose an elective-course sequence to learn specific knowledge
in:

  * Biomedical imaging and instrumentation
  * Biomolecular and tissue engineering
  * Biomechanics
  * Electrobiology

### Double Major

Duke BME students may declare a double major in Biomedical Engineering plus:

  * Civil & Environmental engineering
  * Computer Science
  * Electrical & Computer Engineering
  * Mechanical Engineering

### Second Major or a Minor

With advance preparation, students may also undertake a second major or a
minor in any fields offered by Duke. To do it, they can use unrestricted
electives to take specific courses in these fields.

### Certificates

Duke offers a range of certificate programs for undergraduates. Click below to
browse certificate program lists within the:

  * Pratt School of Engineering
  * Trinity College of Arts & Sciences

## Advising

Due to the high student/faculty ratio in the BME program, the BME faculty does
not directly advise first-year students.

First-year students having questions about BME program that cannot be answered
by their advisers can make an appointment with a BME Advising Consultant. A
consultant can answer questions about BME requirements and help students plan
their course sequence. However, the consultant does not replace a designated
adviser. Students still must meet with their advisers to receive registration
clearance.

For declared BME majors, faculty adviser assignment is based upon the major
interests (e.g., BME/ECE dual major) expressed by the student and the need to
balance the number of advisees per faculty member. An advisers' primary role
is to help students identify course work for each upcoming semester. They are
also available to discuss overall career directions, research opportunities,
and other concerns.

Other helpful resources for students are the Director of Undergraduate Studies
and the Department Chair.
