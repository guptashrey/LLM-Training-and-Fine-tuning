  3. Double major

Become well prepared for a career in software development and health care

Students interested in the intersection of technology and medicine greatly
enhance their Duke experience by pursuing a double major in biomedical
engineering (BME) and computer science (CS).

Students pursuing BME + CS:

  * **Gain practical experience** in computer programming _and_ biomedical
    engineering concepts
  * **Develop a deep understanding** of the evolving relationship between
    technology and health care
  * **Become well prepared for careers** in software development and health
    care

This double-major option capitalizes on the collaborative histories of the two
Duke academic departments. And, it makes it easier for students to explore
courses on topics such as biological computing, software engineering, and
machine learning for biomedical imaging.

> “I’m really glad I did the Duke BME Double Major. It helped me get my career
> at Google Health. I have unique and helpful ways to contribute because of
> what I learned about health care from my biomedical engineering courses.”

> **Suyash Kumar, ’16**  
>  Software Engineer, Google Health

## Sample Curriculums

Students pursuing the BME + CS double major must complete 37 credits from both
programs:

BME (BSE)/ CompSci (BA) Second Major (matriculating classes of 2018, 2019 and
