# Biomedical Engineering + Mechanical Engineering Double Major

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Double major

Become well prepared for a career in biomaterials or biomechanics

Students pursuing BME + ME:

  *  **Collaborate with researchers and faculty** in Duke’s nationally
    recognized biomaterials and materials science community
  *  **Complete research projects** that may involve biological and electronic
    materials and interfaces, therapeutic ultrasound and nanostructures.
  *  **Gain valuable preparation** for a career in the industrial or research
    sectors.

The double major in biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering and
materials science draws on the collaborative relationship between the two
departments to support students interested in work involving biomechanics,
materials science, biomaterials and mechanobiology.
