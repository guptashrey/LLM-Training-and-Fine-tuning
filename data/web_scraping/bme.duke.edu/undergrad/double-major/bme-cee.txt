  2. Undergraduate
  3. Double major

Become well prepared for a career in software development and health care

The double major is designed for students interested in exploring how the
environment can affect human health.

Students pursuing BME + CEE:

  * **Collaborate across disciplines** to solve global challenges posed by
    growing human needs and activities
  * **Explore the connections** between human and environmental health to
    understand risks and build resilience in both living populations and
    global ecosystems
  * **Work with teams around the globe** to help create a healthier, safer and
    more sustainable world.

> “I loved the experience overall, felt like I got a lot out of it, learned a
> lot, saw engineering classes from very different disciplines, formed a lot
> of friends in CEE and BME, and really explored. If the goal of a Pratt
> bachelors is to get you to think creatively about solving different
> engineering problems, then I think it was a fantastic dual-major, and it
> serves me well today as I evaluate very different startups in the clean tech
> space.”
