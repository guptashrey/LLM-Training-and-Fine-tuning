# Biomedical Engineering + Electrical and Computer Engineering Double Major

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Double major

Become well prepared for a career in medical device design

The double major in biomedical engineering and electrical and computer
engineering is an ideal option for students interested in the technical
components behind biomedical engineering tools.

Students pursuing BME + ECE:

  * **Complete interdisciplinary projects** bridging BME, ECE and Duke Health
  * **Collaborate closely with design experts and physicians** as you learn
    how to develop practical biomedical devices and designs
  * **Be well-prepared for a career** in the medical equipment industry, which
    in the US is expected to grow to over $200 billion annually in the coming
    decade.

Students who pursue this curriculum will have the opportunity to participate
in intensive design programs, where they can design medical devices and other
hardware for physicians and researchers.

> “The double major allowed me to explore two areas of study I was passionate
> about. As an ECE, I was able to dive deep into circuits and digital systems,
> and ultimately learn how computers today work. As a BME, I saw these same
> principles at work when learning about medical device design and electrical
> systems within our bodies themselves. Ultimately I was more competitive as a
> job applicant because I'd developed an ability to make connections across
> these areas and go deep in both of them.”
