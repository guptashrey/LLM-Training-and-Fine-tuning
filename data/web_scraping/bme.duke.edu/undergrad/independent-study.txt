# Independent Study

## Breadcrumb

  2. Undergraduate

About a third of BME majors take an independent study course

Independent study research projects are an integral and immensely popular
component of undergraduate BME education at Duke. Up to two such courses may
be counted as BME electives if they are taken in the junior or senior years.

In an independent study course students work with a faculty supervisor to
focus on a special topic of the student's choosing by self-guided readings,
developing and/or running computer simulations, and/or laboratory experiments.

Students participating in the NAE Grand Challenges Scholar Program and/or
contributing to the efforts of the Duke Smart Home may obtain independent
study credits for their work if their project is supervised by a BME faculty.

## Advantages of Independent Study

Independent study course work can be used to satisfy requirements toward
Graduation with Departmental Distinction (GwDD), provided the student's GPA is
at least 3.5.

In addition, the best research projects are eligible for the BME Departmental
awards: the Helmholtz Award, the Clark Awards, and the Edward D. "Ned" Light
Memorial Award.

## Examples of Student Projects

  * Implementing a Rechargeable Battery for an Implantable Neural Acquisition
    System
  * Functional Endoscopic Imaging for Enhanced Detection of Cancerous Lesions
  * Electrophysiological Characterization of a Novel Genetically Engineered
    Biological Pacemaker
  * Biomechanics of Microbicide Gel Distribution and Efficacy
  * Improved In Vivo Visualization of Injected Anesthetics Using Ultrasonic
    Decorrelation Algorithms
  * Emergent Network Bursting and Synchrony in Computer Simulations of
    Neuronal Cultures
  * Evaluation of Pediatric Skull Fracture Imaging Techniques
  * Guidance of Surgical Robotics with 3-D Ultrasound
  * Uses of the Pratt Pouch with Antiretroviral Medication for the Prevention
    of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV
  * Pitch Mismatch in Bilateral Cochlear Implants Using an Acoustic Mode
  * Nanotherapeutics: Dual Functional Nanoparticles for Gene Delivery and
    Tissue Engineering

## GETTING STARTED

Students interested in independent study are encouraged to approach faculty
members to discuss opportunities. For ideas on whom to approach, look through
the BME faculty list for professors whose research and interests match yours.

Students should first meet with their project supervisor to discuss the
project title, its description, biomedical and engineering content of the
project, the nature of the final product, and the grading basis.

* * *

## Independent Study Courses and Programs

After meeting with the project supervisor, and developing a project title,
description, biomedical and engineering content of the project, the nature of
the final project and the grading basis in hand, the student can then
approach:

### BME Design Fellows

An intensive design program for BME juniors, which spans three semesters and a
summer session. The program may include:

  * Medical Device Design 1 & 2
  * Advanced Design and Manufacturing Skills
  * A summer internship at a BME-focused company or Duke University Medical
    Center

The application becomes available in **September**.
