## Presenter

Christopher Bettinger, Biological Technologies Office, DARPA

For more than 50 years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
has held to a singular and enduring mission: to make pivotal investments in
breakthrough technologies for national security. The genesis of that mission
and of DARPA itself dates to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and a commitment by
the United States that, from that time forward, it would be the initiator and
not the victim of strategic technological surprises. This talk will discuss
the mission of DARPA as it applies to warfighter protection. Progress on
programs designing materials, devices, and cell-based systems to reduce
threats and maximize warfighter readiness will be presented. Specific examples
of biotechnologies and devices that can operate within the gastrointestinal
tract will be highlighted.
