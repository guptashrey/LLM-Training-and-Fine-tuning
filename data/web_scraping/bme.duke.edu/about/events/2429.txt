Hemali Rathnayake

Abstract:  
Rathnayake group focuses on designing environmentally benign nanomaterials and
explore their chemical and physical properties for sustainability
applications, specifically focusing on desalination, wastewater remediation,
and critical mineral reclamation. We have developed a series of bio-based
coordination polymer frameworks with high surface area and porosity with
tailored selectivity to capture minerals and impurities in water resources and
convert them for valuable commodities in batteries. As our parent
nanomaterials, we have synthesized bioinspired porous microstructures of
coordination polymer frameworks from natural polyphenols and biopolymers using
green chemistry principles. Supporting their amphoteric sorption,
microstructures exhibit rapid removal of heavy metals, organic dyes, selective
extraction of lithium, and desalination of dissolved solids. These de novo
porous microstructures and their physiochemical surface properties open new
avenues to design thermally and chemically stable, eco-friendly, low-cost
amphoteric sorbents with multifunctionality for adsorption, ion-exchange,
separation, storage, and sensing of both anions and cations present in
heterogeneous media. This research has translated to a point-of use solid-
phase extraction (SPE) flow technology (TRL 4) for direct lithium extraction
(DLE) and conversion to battery grade lithium carbonate from brine resources,
while yielding usable water as a byproduct
