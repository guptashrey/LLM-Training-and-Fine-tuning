## Presenter

Matthew Engelhard, MD, PhD; Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Shelley Rusincovitch, MMCi; Managing Director, Duke AI Health

The transformation in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
is impacting clinical medicine with potential for benefit but also harm. In
this one-hour virtual seminar, we'll introduce AI and ML, highlight
capabilities of current methods for images, text, and other big data in
clinical settings, and discuss considerations in how to use these powerful
methods responsibly. This session will be a high-level introduction accessible
to people with no prior knowledge of AI and ML.  
  
  
  
This is the first of a 3-part AI Health conversation series hosted by Shelley
Rusincovitch:  
  
February 28: What are machine learning and artificial intelligence, and why do
they matter in health? (with Matthew Engelhard)  
  
March 28: What are informatics and data science, and why do they matter in
health? (with Ed Hammond and Warren Kibbe)  
  
April 25: What's important in the ethics and safety of artificial intelligence
in health? (with David Carlson, Sarah Rispin Sedlak, and Jimmy Tcheng)
