## HISTORY

First accredited undergraduate BME program in the U.S.

Since our founding as the Division of Biomedical Engineering in 1967, our
faculty and students have been leaders in biomedical engineering research,
education and innovation.

In 1972, our undergraduate BME program was the first accredited in the United
States. Today, BME is among the largest educational programs at Duke
University.
