# Letter from the Chair

March 24, 2021

Dear colleagues and friends,

Here at Duke BME, we pride ourselves on our ability to forge new paths at the
frontiers of engineering and medicine. Thanks to a strong collaborative
culture, an ever-expanding design curriculum, and faculty who pursue impactful
and important work, Duke BME is constantly pushing the field of biomedical
engineering forward.

In this issue of the Duke BME Magazine, I'm thrilled to highlight the work of
our impressive students, with stories about our first-year engineers creating
an expanded and accessible design space for resource-limited settings, and our
master's students collaborating with physicians in Duke Health to design
innovative and practical medical devices. We've also shared stories about the
work of our trailblazing faculty, with topics spanning optical engineering,
data science and stem cell engineering.

Duke BME is ranked among the top three biomedical engineering programs in the
country, and I think these stories exemplify why our brilliant faculty and
students set us apart from the rest. I hope you enjoy reading our latest
issue.

Best wishes,

**Ashutosh Chilkoti**

Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Chair, Duke Biomedical Engineering
