# Letter from the Chair

October 5, 2021

Dear Colleagues,

**Entrepreneurship. Design-focused education. Forward-thinking faculty.
Impactful research.** These are the signatures of Duke Biomedical Engineering,
and we’ve selected stories that highlight these pillars in our latest virtual
issue of the _Duke BME Magazine_.

I’m thrilled to share features about Duke BME faculty who have advanced the
field of biomedical imaging, research that lets neuroscientists and engineers
explore the circuitry of the brain, and the design and entrepreneurship spaces
in the newly opened Wilkinson Engineering Building. We’ve also shared stories
that describe how our faculty, staff and students are working together to
ensure that Duke BME is a welcoming and inclusive space for all.

With each year our department is evolving and growing, but our goal always
remains the same: to contribute to and improve society through biomedical
innovation. I’m confident that the impressive work of the Duke BME community
ensures that we will always achieve that goal.

I hope you enjoy learning more about our top-ranked department.

Best wishes,

**Ashutosh Chilkoti**

Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Chair, Duke Biomedical Engineering
