# Letter from the Chair

October 7, 2020

Dear colleagues and friends,

One of our goals in Duke Biomedical Engineering is to create solutions to the
world's most pressing biomedical problems. Over the last few months, our
global community has faced an unprecedented challenge in the form of the novel
coronavirus pandemic. But Duke BME's faculty, staff and students have adapted
to this new reality, devising local and global solutions to help us all push
forward.

I'm thrilled to share their work in the virtual issue of the Duke BME
Magazine, with stories that cover the Engineering Response Team as they
develop tools to protect health care workers, highlight the efforts of faculty
as they develop innovative tools and perform global studies to efficiently
identify or diagnose coronavirus infections, and showcase how our instructors
and students creatively adapted lab-based courses for effective virtual
learning.

Our faculty, staff and students are one of the reasons Duke BME is
consistently recognized as one of the best biomedical engineering programs in
the country, and I hope you enjoy learning more about their work in our latest
issue of the Duke BME Magazine.

Wishing you well,

**Ashutosh Chilkoti**

Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Chair, Duke Biomedical Engineering
