# Dolbow Named Assistant VP for Research

April 20, 2020

Charged with improving data management campus-wide

_From Duke Today_

John E. Dolbow, a professor of mechanical engineering & materials science and
mathematics will join the Office of Research as an assistant vice president
for Research, beginning July 1.

“I’ll be working with faculty, students and staff to understand their
challenges within Duke’s research enterprise, and try to develop tools and
processes to help them,” said Dolbow, who’s official charge is to improve the
university’s data management policies. “I expect to focus on areas of long-
term strategic importance to Duke’s research mission, such as aspects of
research data, including storage, provenance, and accessibility.”

Dolbow is a Bass Fellow and a member of the Rhodes Information Initiative and
the Energy Initiative. He is also the director of graduate studies for
mechanical engineering & materials science.

“Progress in these key areas is of strategic importance to Duke’s long-term
research mission, and John’s leadership will be an invaluable addition to the
office,” said Vice President for Research Larry Carin.

outrageously ambitious
