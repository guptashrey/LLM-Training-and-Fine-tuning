# Data-Based Diagnosis

March 3, 2017

Duke engineers are working closely with genome scientists and clinicians to
make important decisions about antibiotic prescriptions

As overuse of antibiotics gives rise to new generations of resistant bacteria,
clinicians face an important decision—hold back the drugs in case the patient
turns out to have a viral infection, or prescribe them just in case? Duke
engineers are working closely with genome scientists and clinicians to make
the decision a snap.

A few years ago, ECE’s Lawrence Carin teamed up with Dr. Geoffrey Ginsburg,
professor of medicine and BME and director of Duke MEDx, to combine
increasingly efficient gene-expression technology with rapid statistical
analysis. A series of DARPA-funded pilot studies proved it possible to read
signals of gene expression activity in response to illness before symptoms set
in—an advance that could speed up treatment and recovery, and help prevent the
spread of disease across populations

Subsequent collaborative projects between the Center for Applied Genomics and
Precision Medicine and ECE have improved the methodology as the researchers
fine-tuned statistical methods to analyze the data. In a recent study
conducted with ECE’s Ricardo Henao, the team proved their technology could
rapidly discern the difference between gene expression caused by viruses and
bacteria in blood samples—paving the way for a new diagnostic test.

Today, the researchers are working with NIH’s Antibacterial Research
Leadership Group and industry partners to translate their innovation into
practice, and designing a clinical trial with Duke Health to validate the
diagnostic tool in a larger, more diverse population.

outrageously ambitious
