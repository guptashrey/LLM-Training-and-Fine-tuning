# Letter from the Engineering Graduate Student Council (EGSC)

June 8, 2020

The Duke EGSC categorically and unequivocally rejects racism and police
brutality against people of color.

Dear Pratt graduate students,

Diversity and inclusion are essential to the mission of the Duke Engineering
Graduate Student Council (EGSC). We would like to echo the sentiments of
President Price, Dean Bellamkonda, and our fellow student leaders in GPSC and
let the Pratt graduate community know that EGSC categorically and
unequivocally rejects racism and police brutality against people of color.

EGSC is committed to promoting the voices of students from all backgrounds and
colors. We stand in solidarity with our black student community and strive to
be an active ally in the fight against systemic injustices. To that end, we
would like to share a list of resources where students can learn more from
black voices about the history of systemic racism and the lived experiences of
communities of color. This list is meant to be a collaborative and ongoing
effort; if you know of any additional resources that you think would be
valuable to share with the Pratt community, please email EGSC and we can add
it to the list!

We are actively working with Duke administrators to advocate for additional
resources to support students and promote equality during these challenging
times. Furthermore, we value the diverse thoughts, opinions, and suggestions
from all Pratt graduate students, and we invite any suggestions on how we can
advocate for meaningful change in our community.

If there is anything that EGSC can do to be of assistance, please contact us
at egsc.pratt@duke.edu

Sincerely,

Duke EGSC

outrageously ambitious
