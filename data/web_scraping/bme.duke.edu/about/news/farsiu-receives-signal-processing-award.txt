# Farsiu Receives Signal Processing Award

September 20, 2017

BME’s Sina Farsiu recognized for role on IEEE Signal Processing Society
Editorial Board

Sina Farsiu, an associate professor in the department of biomedical
engineering (BME) at Duke University, received the “Outstanding Member of the
Editorial Board” award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineering (IEEE) Signal Processing Society in recognition for his exemplary
role as the senior area editor of IEEE’s publication, _Transactions on Image
Processing_ (TIP).

The award is given to editorial board members who have displayed notable
excellence in the timeliness of the review process, effective communication
with authors and reviewers, and a willingness to go the extra distance to
serve the society’s publications. Farsiu was one of four reviewers recognized
from a pool of nearly 100 associate and senior area editors.

Members of the committee who presented the award noted Farsiu’s exceptional
contributions in managing reviews and delivering timely and accurate
decisions, commenting, “Sina has been our leader in all things biomedical. His
senior area editor reviews are informative, impeccable and push a high-quality
standard for TIP.”

Farsiu was named a recipient of the award at the 2017 International Conference
on Image Processing in Beijing, China.
