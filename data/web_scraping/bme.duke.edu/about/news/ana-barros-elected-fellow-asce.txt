# Ana Barros Elected a Fellow of ASCE

September 20, 2016

Ana Barros, the James L. Meriam Professor of Civil and Environmental
Engineering at Duke University, has been elected a Fellow of the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

The honor is bestowed on less than 3.5 percent of the society’s members and
serves to recognize engineers who have made notable contributions to the civil
engineering field and ASCE organization during their career.

Barros’s research focuses on hydrology and environmental physics with an
emphasis on water-cycle processes in complex geological and atmospheric
environments. For example, Barros recently led a field campaign to help
calibrate NASA’s newest weather satellite with ground-based sensors her group
has spent years installing in the western North Carolina mountains. She was
also recently chosen to serve as a panel co-chair of the National Academies’
2017-2027 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space.

Barros earned an undergraduate degree in civil engineering and master’s degree
in ocean engineering from the University of O’Porto, Portugal, before
completing a second master’s degree in environmental science engineering from
the Oregon Institute of Technology in 1990. She then completed her doctorate
in civil and environmental engineering from the University of Washington in
1993. Barros then served on the faculty of the University of O’Porto, Penn
State University and Harvard University before joining the faculty at Duke,
where she has been for the past 12 years.

outrageously ambitious
