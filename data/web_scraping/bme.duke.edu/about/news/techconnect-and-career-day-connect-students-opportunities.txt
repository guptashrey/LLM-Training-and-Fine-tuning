# TechConnect and Career Day Connect Students with Opportunities

November 1, 2022

Dual event brings 120 companies and more than 1500 students together in Wilson
Gym

After two years of virtual events, students and employers were ready and
enthusiastic to connect in person again. On September 21, with over 200
employers and 2,000 students in attendance, Duke University's Wilson Gym was
once again a lively hub of activity for a full day of career-related events.

For the first time, Duke hosted a multi-event career day. In the morning,
TechConnect, hosted by Duke's Pratt School of Engineering and Department of
Computer Science, attracted 92 employers and approximately 1,000 students
interested in STEM. After a quick turnover at noon, additional employers
joined the fair for a total of 120 with over 1,500 students in attendance at
the afternoon all-majors Career Fair, hosted by the Career Center.

The day concluded with an innovative Diversity and Inclusion Reverse Fair in
Penn Pavilion. Over 30 student organizations set up booths so that employers
could visit them to learn about the clubs and share their companies'
diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Both employers and students felt
the day was a huge success for making connections, sharing knowledge and
exploring opportunities, and everyone involved is looking forward to
additional student engagement events during the spring semester.
