# The Foundry Opens for Student Innovation

September 9, 2015

Duke University celebrated the grand opening of its brand new “maker space” on
September 3, 2015.

Dubbed “The Foundry” after a competitive naming contest, the newly renovated
basement of Gross Hall features 7,600 feet of project space for Duke student
teams, faculty, and staff focused on engineering, energy, entrepreneurship,
and sustainability to build ideas from the ground up.

The modular and flexible workspace enriches the student experience by
providing dedicated design and project space for class, co-curricular and
entrepreneurial activities. It’s co-sponsored by the Pratt School of
Engineering, Duke Innovation and Entrepreneurship, the Duke Energy Initiative,
the Information Initiative at Duke, the Innovation Co-lab and the Duke
Department of Physics.

As of the grand opening, The Foundry has become residence to nine clubs and
organizations, including Duke Electric Vehicles, DukeMakers and the Duke
Robotics Club. Below are some photos from the event that shows off just what
The Foundry is capable of supporting.
