# The 'Car Wrecks' Ahead in the World of Artificial Intelligence and
Transportation

June 13, 2019 | by Colin Colter, Duke Government Relations

Duke Engineering experts in automation, autonomy, artificial intelligence and
transportation spend a half-day with policymakers in Washington D.C.

_FromDuke Today  
_

Fragile regulatory processes may prove as much cause for concern as fragile
software systems when it comes to autonomous vehicle development, argued two
Duke professors at a recent conference on the future of artificial
intelligence. As Americans hear about the upcoming artificial intelligence
revolution, the world of transportation seems most prone to quick changes.

The half-day conference for congressional and agency staff May 31 focused on
the policy considerations for human-A.I. collaboration in transportation.

Mary "Missy" Cummings, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab (HAL) at Duke, spoke
about how the makers of autonomous vehicles are still unable to make the leap
into full autonomy, remaining stuck in the automation stage. Miroslav Pajic,
the Nortel Networks Assistant Professor in the Pratt School of Engineering,
spoke on the design and analysis of cyber-physical systems and the wide
variety of weaknesses facing autonomous vehicles.
