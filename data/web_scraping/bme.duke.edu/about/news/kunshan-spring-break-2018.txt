# Spring Break 2018: Environmental Research at Duke Kunshan University

April 19, 2018

A group of Duke students spent their spring break in Kunshan, China,
experimenting with various methods of measuring air and water quality and
learning about the region

_From the Office of Duke Kunshan University Programs_

This March, a group of Duke students led by Civil and Environmental
Engineering Professor Michael Bergin spent their spring break in Kunshan,
China, experimenting with various methods of measuring air and water quality
and learning about the region.

Students in Bergin's class on International Applications of Environmental
Field Methods worked at Duke during the spring semester to design the projects
they conducted in China. The team included six undergraduates from the Pratt
School of Engineering, a Biology senior, and a graduate student in
Environmental Management. Karoline Johnson, a doctoral student in
Environmental Engineering, coordinated the program with support from the
Master of Environmental Policy program at Duke Kunshan University and the Duke
Office of DKU Programs. Funding for the program was provided by the Lord
Foundation, the Office of DKU Programs, the Office of the Vice Provost for
Research, and the Pratt School of Engineering.
