# KEEN Teaching: Duke Engineering Faculty Engage with National Education
Network

December 2, 2021 | Mark Schreiner

Through the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network, faculty create impactful
educational experiences grounded in problem-based learning and an
entrepreneurial mindset

When students in Stacy Tantum's Fundamentals of Data Analysis course set out
to test their skills in data clustering, they leave the textbooks behind.
Instead, they venture into the byzantine world of Division 1 NCAA football
conference membership.

Tantum gives her students at Duke's Pratt School of Engineering the task of
examining how the current university members of the ACC, B1G, Big 12, Pac-10
and SEC are clustered on the map of the United States. (Pro tip: Geography
doesn’t seem to correlate strongly with the conference to which a college
belongs.)

After choosing a mode of analysis and gaining insights as to why the
conferences are populated the way they are (is it access to TV markets?),
students are then challenged to find the best conferences into which to place
the independent teams: Army, BYU, Notre Dame and U-Mass Amherst.

Beyond making the project engaging by using a real-world data set and context,
there's more at work here, said Tantum, the Bell-Rhodes Associate Professor of
the Practice of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

"In the course, students have tackled parts of the question in their textbook
homework problems," she said. "But those are abstract. With the football
conference mini-project, I removed the guardrails, as it were, for the
students. They enter a scenario with lots of details, but not a lot of
explicit cues about what they’re supposed to do to answer the problem."

> Over summer 2021, engineering educator Stacy Tantum attended a four-day
> virtual conference. During the sessions, she heard presentations on
> pedagogical research backing up the value of authentic problem-solving.
> Then, in a break-out session, she and her peers applied those research
> principles in a model teaching exercise—make a prototype and marketable
> holiday ornament to size specifications from chenille stems and some
> modeling dough.

Such an authentic project, presented in an open-ended manner, does a lot of
good things. It sparks curiosity. It makes students seek out connections among
all they've learned in the course (and perhaps other courses). And it gets
them thinking like engineers—about creating a product that another person
would find helpful or valuable.

"In this case, it would be real, actionable insights into why it makes the
most sense, say, that Notre Dame, should be part of the ACC," she said. "What
I'm looking for, almost like a teacher of the humanities or social sciences,
is a well-supported answer to the challenge. The goal for the student is to
put it all together to find a solution."

This past summer, Tantum sought to strengthen her approach to problem-based
teaching by accessing the resources of KEEN: The Kern Entrepreneurial
Engineering Network, which is focused on improving engineering education
through fostering curiosity, connections, and creating value.

Duke Engineering is an active member of the partnership of more than 50
colleges and universities across the United States.

Over summer 2021, Tantum attended a four-day virtual conference of university
engineering educators. During the sessions, she heard presentations on
pedagogical research backing up the value of authentic problem-solving. Then,
in a break-out session, she and her peers applied those research principles in
a model teaching exercise—make a prototype and marketable holiday ornament to
size specifications from chenille stems and some modeling dough.

Duke joined KEEN in 2019. Ann Saterbak, professor of the practice in
biomedical engineering and director of Duke Engineering's First-Year Design
Program, and fellow engineering faculty members Martin Brooke (ECE) and Mark
Palmeri (BME) co-lead the KEEN initiative at Duke.

> The Kern Family Foundation also provided Duke a grant—Purposefully Duke—that
> draws Duke Engineering together with the Duke Divinity School and Duke's
> Kenan Institute for Ethics to integrate discussions and examinations of
> character-based ethics into the student experience.

The Kern Family Foundation also provided Duke a grant—Purposefully Duke—that
draws Duke Engineering together with the Duke Divinity School and Duke's Kenan
Institute for Ethics to integrate discussions and examinations of character-
based ethics into the student experience.

Also, Saterbak is the principal investigator for a project funded by a Kern
grant entitled, "Creating Value: Identifying and Specifying Student Design
Projects."

KEEN shares teaching ideas that build up a student's entrepreneurial
mindset—which KEEN defines as the ability to recognize and identify
opportunities, focus on the impact of those opportunities, and create value in
any context.

Duke Engineering faculty have engaged with the network via conferences,
workshops, and online resources, including contributing their own creative
teaching strategies and ideas to benefit partners at other schools.

“At KEEN workshops and conferences I've learned many educational techniques
that I now use in my classes, such as Scrum, NABC value proposition, and
others,” said Rabih Younes, assistant professor of the practice in ECE. “I
also noticed that KEEN may use different words for many of the same things I
do in my classes. We’re all talking about the same things. It’s been a great
learning opportunity. KEEN helped me refine and optimize my techniques.”

One KEEN resource that Tantum has found engaging is the network's browsable
collection of more than 1,800 "cards"—each one a complete project description
provided by a faculty member at a network university. One attractive 'card'
she discovered posed an authentic project for the teaching of fundamental
solid mechanics—"Build a Stronger Bookshelf."

Being part of the KEEN network has been valuable, said.

"I've been able to see what others are doing," she said, "I have learned new
things and gotten ideas about how I can make my teaching even stronger."
