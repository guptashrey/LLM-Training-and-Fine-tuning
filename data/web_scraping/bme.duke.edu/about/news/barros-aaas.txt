# 3 Faculty Elected Fellows of AAAS

November 27, 2017

Ana Barros recognized for sustained contributions to science

Three Duke faculty have been named Fellows of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS). Election as a AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed
upon AAAS members by their peers to recognize scientifically or socially
distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications.

**Ana P. Barros, Ph.D.** is the James L. Meriam Professor of Civil and
Environmental Engineering. She studies precipitation and hydrology, with a
particular focus on how mountains and land use can affect rainfall. Her
modeling studies have included the Himalayas, the Angola high plateau and the
southern Appalachian mountains.

**David G. Kirsch, M.D., Ph.D.,** is the Barbara Levine University Professor
in the Department of Radiation Oncology, where he is also vice chair for basic
& translational research. Kirsch is also a professor in the Department of
Pharmacology & Cancer Biology. He studies cancer biology, using mouse models
to study radiation oncology and sarcomagenesis.

**Thomas Mitchell-Olds, Ph.D.** is the Newman Ivey White Professor of Biology.
He studies the natural genetic variation in rice and a wildflower called
Boechera, asking questions about flowering time and elevation, insect
resistance and drought resistance, and seeking the genes that affect
ecological success and evolutionary fitness.

This year's AAAS Fellows will be formally announced in the AAAS News & Notes
section of the journal Science on Nov. 24, 2017. There are 396 new fellows
being recognized this year. The new Fellows will be inducted on Saturday, Feb.
17 during the 2018 AAAS Annual Meeting in Austin, Texas.
