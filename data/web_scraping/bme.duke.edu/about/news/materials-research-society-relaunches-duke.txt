# Materials Research Society Relaunches at Duke

May 8, 2020

Student group coordinates with faculty in materials research

The student chapter of the Materials Research Society has relaunched at Duke
University under new student leadership and has 50 members, according to
Vasishta Somayaji, master’s student in the University Program in Materials
Science and Engineering (UPMSE) and liaison to the Duke Materials Initiative.
Adrienne Stiff-Roberts, Jeffrey N. Vinik Professor of Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Director of Graduate Studies for the UPMSE, and David Mitzi,
Simon Family Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science, are faculty advisors.

It is an independent student-run organization under the umbrella of the global
professional Materials Research Society. The primary goal of the group is to
facilitate association and communication between students and faculty members
working in the field of materials science to promote on- and off-campus
research. It will also serve as a framework within which students in the
materials discipline can convene, collaborate and advocate.

The group plans to have formal activities such as symposiums, poster
competitions, field trips, mentoring programs, panel discussions, career
readiness seminars and industrial social events. It also intends to organize
informal social events like trivia nights, science and art competitions, along
with innovation and creativity festivals. For more information about its
officers and activities, go to the Materials Research Society at Duke website.
