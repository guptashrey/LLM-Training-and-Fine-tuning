# “A Joyful Day”: Dedicating the Wilkinson Building

November 17, 2021

More than 200 well-wishers gathered Saturday, November 13 to celebrate the
opening of Duke Engineering’s new Wilkinson Building

A beautiful fall weekend brought about a long-awaited public celebration of
Duke Engineering’s new Wilkinson Building, one full year after the
150,000-square-foot space first opened in the midst of the COVID pandemic.

More than 200 alumni and friends, faculty, students and staff turned out
Saturday, November 13 for the formal dedication ceremony, which recognized the
naming of the building in honor of longtime supporters Jerry C. and Beverly A.
Wilkinson and their family and honored the many donors whose generous
contributions made the facility possible.

“Today is a joyful and historic day,” said Duke University President Vincent
E. Price in opening remarks at the ceremony. “This extraordinary building
reflects our long legacy of first-class engineering education and our
commitment to the future of engineering at Duke. Already, you can walk through
these doors and see our students, faculty, and researchers hard at work
inventing the 21st century. We are so grateful to all of you for making that
happen here, at Duke.”

In addition to remarks from Price and Provost Sally Kornbluth, former dean of
engineering Ravi Bellamkonda and interim dean Jeff Glass, Jerry Wilkinson
shared the story of his nearly 60-year engagement with engineering at Duke
University, beginning as a 17-year-old freshman on a need-based scholarship.
Now the founder and chairman of the Wilkinson Companies, Jerry and his wife,
Bev, have a long history of philanthropy and service in support of Duke
Engineering, and are parents of three daughters who are also Duke alumnae.

Following the dedication, Duke Engineering students and faculty led tours to
showcase the Wilkinson Building’s education, research and entrepreneurship
spaces, and art collection. See below for highlights of the day, and visit
