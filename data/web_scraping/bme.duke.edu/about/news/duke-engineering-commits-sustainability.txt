# Duke Engineering Commits to Sustainability

June 10, 2019

School-wide 'GREENgineering' initiative to reduce waste, boost recycling and
save energy

In fall 2018, Dean Ravi V. Bellamkonda posed a challenge to Duke Engineering
faculty, staff and students: Could they find high-impact ways to make the
Pratt School of Engineering greener and more environmentally sustainable? What
would the world look like if we led the campus in this space?

In the months since, the response to that challenge has built strong
partnerships with campus sustainability leaders, produced a punch list of
projects, and made significant strides toward the goal of a more sustainable
Duke Engineering.

The community-wide initiative is called GREENgineering.

## Focused on Achievable, High-Impact Projects

It’s focused on high-impact yet achievable projects related to improving
sustainability awareness, increasing recycling and reducing waste and energy
use.

“As I observed our community, and my own behavior, I knew there were things we
could do to be more sustainable,” Bellamkonda said. “We are a top-10 school in
environmental engineering, and I felt strongly that we could use our expertise
to improve our local environment and show leadership on campus.”

That expertise—coming from students as well as faculty and staff—was already
well in evidence.

The school has begun construction on a new classroom and research building
whose LEED-registered design sets a high bar for sustainable design and energy
efficiency. Also, an engineering student team, led by first-year students
associated with the Duke Smart Home, piloted a cost-saving LED lighting
upgrade project in Duke Engineering’s Hudson Hall in 2017. The success of that
pilot has grown into an official university-wide program to replace lighting
fixtures for substantial energy and cost savings.

Responding to the new sustainability challenge, a core team of volunteers met
with partners across Duke Engineering and Duke to collect potential project
ideas.

## Tapping Faculty, Staff and Student Expertise

“What we learned confirmed for us that sustainability is a huge issue,” said
GREENgineering co-lead Lee Ferguson, an associate professor of civil and
environmental engineering. “One of the first challenges was finding just where
to begin. The way forward was thinking like an engineer.”

The team, Ferguson said, scored each project idea by impact and by effort, and
then chose to first tackle the items with the highest potential impact,
quickest turnaround and lowest estimated cost.

These included:

  * Working with Duke Stores to switch to vending machines that dispense only
    aluminum cans
  * Working with Duke Facilities Management to install more bottle-filling
    water coolers in engineering buildings
  * Creating an online guide for staff members on planning sustainable events
    and compiling a list of “green” event vendors [ _Use your NetID to access

## Focus Area: Faculty Research Labs

“These were simple things that didn’t cost much, and they had an immediate
effect,” said fellow GREENgineering co-lead Kelly Rockwell, executive
assistant to Dean Bellamkonda.

The green-event guidelines include providing buffet-style food instead of
boxed meals, eliminating single-use plastic water bottles by using reusable
water dispensers, and encouraging attendees to bring their own mug or water
bottle when appropriate.

In another example, the spring meeting of Duke Engineering’s 66-member Board
of Visitors became genuinely paperless. Members accessed documents through a
secure password-protected website, saving reams of paper.

A significant goal of the initiative is to have each of Duke Engineering’s 77
faculty research laboratories achieve Green Lab Certification through
Sustainable Duke by the start of the fall 2019 semester.

The impact would be big—research labs use five times more energy on average
than other campus spaces. A single fume hood, for example, can cost $5,000 per
year to power, a utility cost equal to 3.5 typical homes.

Civil & Environmental Engineering PhD students Trisha Dupnock, recipient of a
2019 Duke Sustainability Award, and Jake Ulrich are heading GREENgineering’s
faculty research lab sustainability effort.

The labs team organized a free Sustainable Labs workshop for their colleagues
on April 15. They also worked with Bellamkonda to create a rebate program to
help labs buy super-efficient ultra-low freezers.

## Recycling Beyond Bottles and Office Paper

Other GREENgineering efforts now underway will improve signage and
communication to promote recycling of nitrile gloves, pipette-tip boxes,
plastic film, polystyrene foam, printer cartridges, and batteries.

Meanwhile, the team is working with the Duke Engineering First-Year Design
Program and the Duke Smart Home Club to apply student innovation to some of
the challenges—including an efficient and effective design for a dishwashing
station for office or student lounge areas far from a break room or kitchen.

Student leaders have emerged to charter a new volunteer club that will oversee
and manage recycling bins to be placed in classrooms.

To help support its efforts, GREENgineering has attracted funding, including
$24,000 from an anonymous donor and a $1,000 grant from Sustainable Duke.

“I have been very impressed with the breadth and organization of the
GREENgineering efforts,” said Tavey Capps, Duke’s sustainability director.
“GREENgineering is the perfect example of what can be achieved with
sustainability efforts on campus that have senior-level leadership support and
grassroots engagement. Sustainable Duke is excited to continue and expand this
partnership with the Pratt School of Engineering.”
