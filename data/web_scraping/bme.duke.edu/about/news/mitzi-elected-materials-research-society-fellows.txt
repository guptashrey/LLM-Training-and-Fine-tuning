# Mitzi Elected to Materials Research Society Fellows

February 10, 2018

David Mitzi has been elected to the 2018 class of Materials Research Society
Fellows.

David Mitzi, Simon Family Professor with faculty appointments in the
Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and in the
Department of Chemistry, has been elected to the 2018 class of Materials
Research Society Fellows.

The honor recognizes Mitzi's outstanding contributions to the advancement of
materials research. He was cited by the society for "groundbreaking research
in solution–processed inorganic and hybrid inorganic–organic semiconductors
and for their application for energy conversion and high-performance
electronics."

The Materials Research Society (MRS) has more than 14,000 members from over 90
countries. MRS Fellows are outstanding members of the society whose sustained
and distinguished contributions to the advancement of materials research are
internationally recognized. The highly selective honor is limited each year to
0.2 percent of the current society's regular membership.

Mitzi’s research interests involve making emerging photovoltaic materials more
effective, cost-efficient and competitive for the energy market. He holds a
number of patents. He is also a faculty network member of the Duke University
Energy Initiative.

Prior to joining Duke in 2014, Dr. Mitzi spent 23 years with IBM, including
five years as manager of the company's Photovoltaic Science and Technology
Department.
