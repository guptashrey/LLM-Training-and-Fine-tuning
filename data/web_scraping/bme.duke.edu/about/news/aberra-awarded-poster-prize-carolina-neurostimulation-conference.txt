# Aberra Awarded Poster Prize at Carolina Neurostimulation Conference

June 12, 2019

PhD student Aman Aberra was recognized for his research surrounding
transcranial magnetic stimulation

Aman Aberra, a PhD student in Duke University’s Department of Biomedical
Engineering, was awarded the first place Best Poster Award at the 2019
Carolina Neurostimulation Conference (CNC) held at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill for his poster, "Multi-scale modeling of transcranial
magnetic stimulation in head model with morphologically-realistic cortical
neurons.” This conferenced hosted international experts in brain stimulation,
network dynamics, and modeling and analysis of brain activity.

Aman works in the laboratories of Warren Grill and Angel Peterchev, where he
uses computational models to understand how various brain stimulation
technologies affect neural activity at the single-cell and population levels.
His focus has been on noninvasive technologies that alter brain activity by
delivering electromagnetic energy through the scalp, like transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is used clinically to map brain function and
treat drug-resistant depression, and it is being investigated for a number of
other disorders. However, its mechanisms of action are still relatively
unknown. Using computational models, Aman seeks to understand better the
underlying mechanisms of TMS, which will help improve the efficacy of TMS as a
therapeutic tool for a range of clinical applications.

outrageously ambitious
