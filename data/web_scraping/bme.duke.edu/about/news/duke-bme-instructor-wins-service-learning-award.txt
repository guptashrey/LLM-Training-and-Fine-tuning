# Duke BME Instructor Wins Service-Learning Award

April 17, 2019

Kevin Caves has been named the winner of the 2019 Betsy Alden Outstanding
Service-Learning Award at Duke.

Duke biomedical engineering instructor Kevin Caves has been named the winner
of the faculty 2019 Betsy Alden Outstanding Service-Learning Award at Duke
University.

The honor recognizes a faculty member for commitment to the ideals of
service‐learning.

He teaches the BME 460L: Design for People with Disabilities, a capstone
senior design service-learning course for biomedical engineers. In it,
students are matched with a community member to develop and tailor assistive
technology projects.

“I’m looking for people with problems for whom solutions don’t exist, or with
existing solutions that we could make significant improvements to," Caves
said. "The class challenges students to design, build, prototype, test and
build a device that will actually get used by real people after they’re done.”

A team of students in the spring 2016 BME 460L course won the SourceAmerica
Design Challenge, a national engineering competition. Caves also advises the
student group Project Tadpole, which modifies and fixes toys for physically
challenged children and helps teach their parents how to do the same. He was
also a part of the 2018 Teaching for Equity Fellows Program.

At the Duke University School of Medicine, he is a clinical associate in the
departments of Surgery and Medicine.
