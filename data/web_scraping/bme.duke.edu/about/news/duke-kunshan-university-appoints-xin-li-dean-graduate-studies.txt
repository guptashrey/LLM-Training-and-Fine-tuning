March 19, 2021

Duke Kunshan University has appointed Xin Li, professor of electrical and

Duke Kunshan University (DKU) has appointed Xin Li, professor of electrical
and computer engineering (ECE), as its inaugural dean of graduate studies. Li
has served as director of the Master of Engineering degree program in ECE at
DKU since its launch in 2018.

Li will provide academic, intellectual and administrative leadership to
develop a collaborative support system across the university’s five graduate
programs, and ensure excellence in research, teaching, and service to society.
While assuming new responsibilities as dean of graduate studies, he will
continue in his role as professor at both DKU and Duke ECE.

“I’m honored and excited to take on this new role to further develop and grow
Duke Kunshan’s graduate programs, in close collaboration with our distinct
undergraduate program,” said Li. “I look forward to working with the
leadership team and other colleagues to offer high-quality, innovative
education and research opportunities to our students.”
