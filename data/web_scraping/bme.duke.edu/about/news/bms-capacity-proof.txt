# Information Theorists Settle 70-Year-Old Communications Question

November 22, 2021 | By Ken Kingery

Colleagues call Duke mathematical proof ‘stunning achievement’ that could have
broad implications

Since their creation nearly 70 years ago, Reed-Muller codes have been used to
help transmit data in wireless communication, particularly in deep-space
applications. With many codes for computer scientists to choose from, their
popularity stems from their ability to correct errors caused by noisy
transmissions without taking up too much of the channel’s capacity.

Proving capacity for different codes on various channels has been a pursuit of
information theorists since 1948, when MIT’s Claude Shannon first introduced
the idea of channel capacity. In a paper that essentially created the field of
information theory, Shannon showed that any communications channel could be
characterized by its bandwidth and noise. Given a channel with a particular
bandwidth and noise characteristic, he demonstrated how to calculate the
maximum rate at which data could be transmitted essentially without error.
That rate is what is now known as the Shannon capacity.

Now, information theorists have proven that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity
-- the maximum rate of information transmission -- on a large set of channels
known as binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. The proof has been
pursued by many electrical engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians
over the years for various communication channels, with the simplest case of
the binary erasure channel having been resolved just four years ago.

The newly released mathematical proof could eventually help communication
systems become more efficient and use less power. But the more important
contribution is to the mathematical study of inference problems in high
dimension, because the techniques used in the proof could help researchers
attack a wide variety of other problems.

The results were posted online to the arXiv on October 27, a non-peer-reviewed
repository of scientific papers commonly used by researchers to receive
feedback from peers before publication. The paper is currently under review in
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.

“It’s been recognized for some time that Reed-Muller codes are likely to
achieve capacity on symmetric channels, but nobody had any good idea of how
you might be able to prove it,” said Henry Pfister, professor of electrical
and computer engineering and mathematics at Duke.

“It’s a difficult problem to solve because there’s no obvious handle to grab
hold of when working through the proof,” added Galen Reeves, professor of
electrical and computer engineering and statistics at Duke. “But if you can
find a place to start, then a path starts to become clear.”

That handle became available in 2016 when Pfister and his coauthors, including
graduate student Santhosh Kumar, proved Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity on
the binary erasure channel—the simplest model of a communication channel. The
insights gleaned from this proof sparked discussions between Pfister and
Reeves about how to tackle a proof for the much wider and more complex binary
memoryless symmetric channels. The resulting ideas were promising enough for
the pair to secure a multiyear, $500,000 grant from the National Science
Foundation.

“Ever since Shannon’s original work, which used a so-called ‘random coding’
approach, coding theorists have been trying to prove that capacity can be
achieved with constructive codes, for which deterministic encoding and
decoding procedures are available,” explained Daniel Costello, the Bettex
Chair Professor Emeritus in the University of Notre Dame’s Department of
Electrical Engineering, who was not involved with the work. “This is important
because random codes cannot be efficiently implemented in practice.”

“People have long suspected that Reed-Miller codes might be capacity-achieving
if decoded by more sophisticated ‘modern’ decoding methods,” added Dave
Forney, a longstanding leader in the field and key figure in the development
of the high-speed modem, who was not involved with the work. “Reeves and
Pfister have now proved that this is true for a very broad class of channels,
which include all of the most interesting standard channels.”

> possibly have an impact beyond the fields of information theory and error-
> correction coding.”

For this proof, the pair had to develop new mathematical tools as they worked
their way toward the result. While Pfister had an initial insight that started
the process, they mostly worked together to formulate the proof for the
Gaussian channel, which is the standard BMS channel used to model wireless
communications. Then, Reeves developed the final mathematical framework that
worked for all BMS channels and pushed them over the finish line.

“Many of us in the coding theory and theoretical computer science community
have spent a considerable effort trying to make headway on this classic and
important problem,” said Rüdiger Urbanke, information theorist and professor
at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland. “But despite
all our attempts we have found progress to be elusive. It is a stunning
achievement to see it now resolved. And the proof is one for the book.”

The relatively short and elegant proof presented by Pfister and Reeves could
open new opportunities for low-power, efficient decoders for communications
devices. But according to the researchers, the mathematical approaches used in
the ‘proof for the book’ present a path toward solving other challenges, and
not just those in information theory.

“The methods that Reeves and Pfister use in their proof are likely to be of
independent interest,” said Forney, adjunct professor emeritus of the
Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. “Since modern coding theory and its analysis techniques are
closely related to the methods and analysis techniques of deep learning, this
paper may possibly have an impact beyond the fields of information theory and
error-correction coding.”
