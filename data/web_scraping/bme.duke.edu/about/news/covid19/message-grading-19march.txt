# Message Regarding Grading for 500+ Level Classes

_March 19, 2020_

Dear Pratt faculty and students,

Please see the message sent today from Provost Sally Kornbluth to Duke
University graduate and professional students regarding changes to the grading
policy for graduate-level courses (numbered 500+ and above).

At Pratt, all graduate-level course grades will be recorded on transcripts as
S/U for the Spring 2020 semester (where S is equivalent to C- or above).
However, faculty will continue to grade assignments as usual, and students may
choose to receive a letter grade for any 500+ level course by submitting a
form to the registrar no later than 5 pm EST on the last day of graduate
classes – Wednesday, April 15.

PLEASE NOTE that this date is a week earlier than the last day of
undergraduate courses, April 22. Students taking undergraduate courses
(numbered 499 or below) can request a letter grade option for those courses
until 5 p.m. EST on April 22.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us or reach out to your DGS
or DMS.

_Jennifer West_  
 _Associate Dean for PhD Education_
