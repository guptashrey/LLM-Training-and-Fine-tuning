# Farshid Guilak Inaugural Recipient of Biomedical Engineering Society
Innovator Award for Cell and Molecular Bioengineering

January 31, 2014

Professor of orthopaedic surgery, biomedical engineering and mechanical
engineering and materials science at Duke

Farshid Guilak, professor of orthopaedic surgery, biomedical engineering and
mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke, has been named the
inaugural recipient of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Innovator
Award for Cell and Molecular Bioengineering. BMES is the premier organization
in bioengineering, covering all aspects of engineering and technology to
advance human health and well-being. The award was presented to Guilak in
January 2014 during the society’s annual conference in La Jolla, Calif.

Guilak was lauded for his many contributions to the field, including recent
research on osteoarthritis. His lab demonstrated the ability to produce an
unlimited number of stem cells that can turn into cartilage in a mouse model.
This is an important line of research as cartilage is not able to regenerate
on its own within the human body. He is furthering his research by combining
genome editing, gene therapy and synthetic biology to modify the genome of the
cell in a way that will let researchers engineer completely new biological
therapies for arthritis.

“It is especially impressive that Farsh is the inaugural recipient as there is
no doubt a significant build-up of deserving candidates,” said Tom Katsouleas,
Vinik Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering. “His contributions to the
field, and to Duke and to Pratt, are simply extraordinary. I can’t say enough
how very proud we all are of him.”

outrageously ambitious
