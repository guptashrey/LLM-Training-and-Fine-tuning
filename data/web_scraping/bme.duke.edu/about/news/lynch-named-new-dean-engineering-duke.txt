# Jerome Lynch Named New Dean of Pratt School of Engineering

September 2, 2021

University of Michigan chair is nationally known for developing smart
technologies to improve civil infrastructure systems

From _Duke Today_

Jerome Lynch, a nationally recognized expert in advanced sensing and
information technologies for monitoring and control of civil infrastructure
systems, and an advocate for community engagement in research, has been named
the Vinik Dean of Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering.

Lynch will join Duke on January 1, 2022, from the University of Michigan,
where he is the Donald Malloure Department Chair of Civil and Environmental
Engineering. He succeeds Ravi Bellamkonda, who stepped down to become provost
and executive vice president for academic affairs at Emory University.

“I am thrilled to welcome Jerry Lynch to Duke as the next Vinik Dean of the
Pratt School of Engineering,” said President Vincent E. Price. “In his time at
the University of Michigan, he has demonstrated extraordinary leadership, both
as an administrator and scholar and as an engaged advocate for smart and
inclusive urban growth. We are excited that he will bring his talents and
vision to Duke and the future of our engineering programs, and I look forward
to working with him closely in the years ahead.”

A member of the University of Michigan faculty since 2003, Lynch has focused
on developing both technologies and partnerships to build smarter, healthier
communities.

He co-directs the University of Michigan Urban Collaboratory, an
interdisciplinary research institute that partners with city leaders and
residents to prototype solutions to community challenges using smart city
technologies and socially engaged design methods. There he created the
“Sensors in a Shoebox” program to engage Detroit teens in urban engineering
challenges related to air quality, space usage, walkability, and urban noise
levels.

> engineering programs.”

> **Vincent Price** , President of Duke University

As chair of Michigan’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering since
2017, Lynch has overseen significant growth in both research expenditures and
student enrollment. Under his leadership the department instituted a five-year
action plan to support diversity, equity and inclusion, and launched the
Pelham Scholars program, an academic-industry partnership that supports
undergraduate and master's degree students committed to enhancing diversity by
providing mentorship and one year of graduate-level tuition support.

“I am delighted to welcome Jerry Lynch to Duke,” said Provost Sally Kornbluth.
“He has demonstrated a remarkable commitment to advancing engineering
research, education and practice, and to engaging with communities to use
science to address critical challenges. I am grateful to the search committee
for their thorough work, and to Jeff Glass for his interim leadership of the
Pratt School of Engineering.”

Lynch’s own research focuses on cyber-physical systems for adaptive
infrastructure, development of structural health monitoring for infrastructure
management, and the creation of multifunctional nanoengineered thin films
tailored for damage detection.

He served from 2009-2014 as director of the $19.2 million National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Technology Innovation Program Center on
Cyber-Enabled Wireless Monitoring Systems for the Protection of Deteriorating
Infrastructure Systems.

Lynch also has extensive experience commercializing engineering technologies.
He holds three U.S. patents, has two patents pending, and has founded two
companies – Civionics and Sensametrics – to implement commercial applications
of his research.

“It is a great honor to join the Duke community as the Vinik Dean of the Pratt
School of Engineering,” said Lynch. “I am inspired by the broad excellence of
the school and its unwavering commitment to serve society through innovation.”

Lynch’s appointment follows a national search chaired by Stefan Zauscher,
professor of mechanical engineering and materials science, and conducted by a
committee of faculty from across the university, with participation from staff
and student leaders in the Pratt School of Engineering.

“Jerry is a dynamic, insightful leader with forward-thinking ideas about the
future of engineering education and research and its role in meeting societal
needs,” said Zauscher. “The committee was impressed by his strong track record
as chair of a leading engineering department, as well as his thoughtful,
impactful approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and his collaborative
leadership style. We look forward to welcoming Jerry and to his contributions
as the next Vinik Dean of Engineering.”

Lynch is a fellow of the Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) of the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). His work has been recognized with honors
and awards including the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, a
National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Presidential Early Career Award
for Scientists and Engineers, the EMI Leonardo da Vinci Award from the
American Society of Civil Engineers, and the ASCE Huber Award.

A graduate of the undergraduate program in civil and environmental engineering
at The Cooper Union, Lynch began his career working as a structural engineer.
He then completed his master’s degree and Ph.D. in civil and environmental
engineering, as well as a second master’s degree in electrical engineering, at
Stanford University.

With almost 1,300 undergraduates and 1,500 graduate students, four academic
departments, and the industry-focused Institute for Enterprise Engineering and
Duke Engineering Entrepreneurship (EngEn) initiative, the Pratt School of
Engineering is dedicated to educating the next generation of leaders and
developing innovations to address pressing societal challenges.

External research funding has nearly doubled over the past decade, with Duke
Engineering faculty winning some $97 million in new research awards last year.
Known for extensive interdisciplinary collaborations both across the
university and with national and international partners, the Pratt School is
home to major research centers focused on artificial intelligence for edge
computing, biomolecular and tissue engineering, metamaterials, photonics,
environmental implications of new materials, materials science, materials
genomics, quantum computing, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), among
others.
