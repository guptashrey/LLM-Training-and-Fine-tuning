On Monday, November 4, 2019, the Duke Office of Interdisciplinary Studies,
Duke Research, Duke Faculty Advancement, and Duke Science and Society put on
an event titled, "Talent from All Corners: How Immigration Helps Shape
American Scientific Leadership.” The brainchild of Nobel Laureate Robert

stories about how immigration has impacted them personally and professionally.

Speakers from Duke Engineering included Ravi Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean of the
Pratt School of Engineering; Samira Musah, assistant professor of biomedical
engineering; Guillermo Sapiro, the James B. Duke Professor of Engineering;
Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr, Professor of Biomedical Engineering;
and Larry Carin, the James L. Meriam Professor of Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Duke's vice president for research.
