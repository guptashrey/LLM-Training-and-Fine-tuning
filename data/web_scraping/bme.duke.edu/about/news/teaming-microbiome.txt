# Teaming the Microbiome

March 3, 2017

Machine learning techniques have begun to revolutionize our understanding of
how bacteria influence human and environmental health

If ever a match were made in scientific heaven, it’s between Big Data and
Bioinformatics. Machine learning techniques have already begun to
revolutionize our understanding of how bacteria influence human and
environmental health and can efficiently produce a wide variety of products.

Getting biologists and statisticians to speak the same language, however, is
not as straightforward. Funded by $3 million from the National Science
Foundation, the Integrative Bioinformatics Graduate Training Program to
Investigate and Engineer Microbiomes (IBIEM) promotes team science by bringing
Duke and NC A&T University graduate students in engineering, microbiology, and
other disciplines together to work on real-world projects and engage with
local companies conducting microbiome-related research.

“All too often scientists only think about statistics at the end of an
experiment, which can create issues for the data analysis and rigor in how
good the experiment actually is,” said IBIEM director Claudia Gunsch of Duke
CEE. “Having students and scientists that are able to communicate across these
disciplines and think about the statistics from the start saves a lot of time
in the long run and helps produce higher-quality data.”
