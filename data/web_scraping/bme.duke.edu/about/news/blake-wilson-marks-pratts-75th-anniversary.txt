# Blake Wilson marks Pratt's 75th anniversary

March 6, 2015

A photo

_This photo appeared originally inDuke Today:_

Blake Wilson, right, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering, electrical
and computer engineering, and surgery at Duke and co-director of the Duke
Hearing Center, gave the Duke Engineering 75th Anniversary Lecture on March 5,
2015, in Baldwin Auditorium.

Wilson spoke about the modern cochlear implant, for which he won the 2015
Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize and which has helped more than 320,000
people hear worldwide.

In the 1980s, Wilson developed the “continuous interleaved sampling” system,
which made it possible for cochlear implant recipients to understand words and
sentences with far greater clarity than before.

Wilson’s breakthrough provided the basis for sound-processing strategies used
widely in today’s cochlear implants and resulted in a rapid expansion in the
number of deaf and nearly deaf persons who have received a cochlear implant in
one or both ears. Today, the great majority of CI users can talk on phones and
follow conversations in relatively quiet environments.

The talk was part of a year-long series of events for the anniversary. Pratt
Dean Tom Katsouleas (pictured left) introduced Wilson.
