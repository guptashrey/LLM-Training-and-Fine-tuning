# Duke Entrepreneurs Advance Projects in Summer Accelerator

August 12, 2019

Two recent Duke Engineering graduates used Duke I&E's inaugural Summer
Accelerator to focus on their startup that uses 3D-printing technology to
create anatomically fitting padding designed to prevent and protect injuries

The inaugural Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship Summer Accelerator concluded
last week, having helped scores of Duke students and recent alums share their
entrepreneurial spirit and drive to change the world.

Among these groups were Clark Bulleit (BME '19) and Kevin Gehsmann (ME '19),
who played football for Duke, used their engineering background to create a
brace for teammate Daniel Jones after he fractured his clavicle last
September. They collaborated with the team's medical personnel and utilized
the Innovation Co-Lab and other Duke resources to create a custom product that
would maximize security and mobility—enabling the quarterback to return to the
field in just three weeks. Based on that experience, the two cofounded
Protect3d, which uses 3D-printing technology to create anatomically fitting
padding designed to prevent and protect injuries. They're aiming to make this
technology fast and affordable so it can be used in training rooms everywhere.

outrageously ambitious
