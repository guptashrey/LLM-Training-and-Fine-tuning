# Duke Engineering Celebrates Class of 2014

May 12, 2014

Duke University awarded degrees to 428 undergraduate and graduate engineering
students on Sunday, May 11, in ceremonies that began with university-wide
commencement exercises at Wallace Wade Stadium and included Pratt School of
Engineering celebrations at Cameron Indoor Stadium and Duke Chapel. Adding to
students who graduated in September and Fall of 2013, this brings the total
Class of 2014 up to 630.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey,
delivered the University’s commencement address, while Pratt Dean Tom
Katsouleas and Senior Class President Andy Hoang Tran spoke at the
undergraduate engineering school ceremonies. Jeffrey Glass, professor of
electrical and computer engineering and Hogg Family Director of Engineering
Management and Entrepreneurship, addressed the MEM and MEng graduates at the
Diploma Ceremony on Sunday.

Katsouleas awarded Bachelor of Science in Engineering diplomas to 256 students
(265 total for the Class of 2014). He also presented diplomas to 57 Master's
of Science and 31 PhD engineering graduates (a Class of 2014 total of 109 and
68 total, respectively). Watch the MS and PhD ceremony.

Sixty-four Master of Engineering Management and 20 Master of Engineering
degrees were also awarded on May 11 (total graduates of those programs for the
academic year, including September and Fall 2013, were 143 and 45,
respectively). Watch the MEng and MEM ceremony.

Overall, Duke awarded degrees to about 1,656 undergraduates and 2,298 graduate
