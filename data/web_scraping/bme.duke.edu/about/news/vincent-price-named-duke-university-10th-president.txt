# Vincent Price Named Duke University 10th President

December 2, 2016

Penn provost and noted public opinion scholar to take office July 1

Vincent Price, provost of the University of Pennsylvania since 2009, has been
elected Duke University's tenth president, announced David Rubenstein, chair
of the university's Board of Trustees, on Friday.

In addition to being the chief academic officer at Penn, Price is the Steven
H. Chaffee Professor of Communication in the Annenberg School for
Communication and professor of political science in the School of Arts and
Sciences.

Price, 59, was selected by Duke's Board of Trustees Friday morning. He will
succeed Richard H. Brodhead on July 1, 2017. Brodhead announced in April that
he planned to step down after 13 years as president.

"I am thrilled that Vincent Price has been named as our next president," said
Ravi Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering. "We are
fortunate to have experienced tremendous growth at Duke Engineering under
President Brodhead’s leadership, and I am confident that we will grow to even
greater heights under the leadership of incoming President Price. He has an
outstanding track record as a visionary and effective leader, most recently at
an outstanding institution where ENIAC (one of the world’s first general-
purpose computers) was built, and where biomedical and environmental research
are strong. As a result, I am confident that he is well-versed with the role,
and the promise, of a strong engineering program in realizing Duke’s vision of
helping to create and shape the world’s future."
