# Porporato Receives American Geophysical Union Hydrological Sciences Award

July 11, 2016

The honor is given for outstanding contributions to the field of hydrology
over a career

Amilcare Porporato, the Addy Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,
has been named the winner of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Hydrologic
Sciences Award. Originally established in 1956 as the Robert E. Horton Award,
the honor is given for outstanding contributions to the field of hydrology
over a career, with an emphasis on the past five years. It is the highest
disciplinary recognition for senior scientists within the hydrology section,
one of 11 in the AGU.

Porporato’s research involves nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems,
hydrometeorology and soil-atmosphere interaction, soil moisture and plant
dynamics, soil biogeochemistry and ecohydrology. For example, his recent
studies have shown that certain regions of the tropics will likely experience
growing unpredictability of their seasonal cycles of rain and drought, and
that global population growth could outpace water supply by mid-century if
current levels of consumption continue.

The American Geophysical Union’s 7,000 members are concerned with the cycling
of continental water (solid, liquid and vapor) at all scales, and with
physical, chemical and biological processes driven by that cycling. The
mission of the AGU is to promote discovery in Earth and space science for the
benefit of humanity.

outrageously ambitious
