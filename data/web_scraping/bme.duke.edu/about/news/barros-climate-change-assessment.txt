# Barros Provides Scientific Expertise for New N.C. Climate Change Assessment

March 13, 2020

The North Carolina Climate Science Report benefits from the scientific
expertise of two Duke University faculty members

_From the Nicholas School of the Environment_

The new North Carolina Climate Science Report, issued March 11, benefits from
the scientific expertise of two Duke University faculty members.

Ana P. Barros, the Edmund T. Pratt, Jr. School Distinguished Professor of
Civil and Environmental Engineering and an expert on precipitation dynamics
and flood hazards in mountainous regions, and Wenhong Li, associate professor
of climate at the Nicholas School of the Environment who is widely cited for
her work on climate modeling and extreme precipitation, both served on the
report’s climate science advisory panel.

The report documents changes that already have occurred in North Carolina as a
result of global warming and projects likely future effects.

Two sets of projections are provided: one for if greenhouse gas emissions
continue to increase through the end of the century, and another for if
emissions rise at a slower rate, peak around mid-century and then drop.

“Our scientific understanding of the climate system strongly supports the
conclusion that large changes in North Carolina’s climate, much larger than at
any time in the state’s history, are very likely by the end of his century
under both the lower and higher scenarios,” the report’s 15 authors write.

Key observed and projected changes include:

## TEMPERATURE

  * 2019 was the warmest year on record for the state, and 2009-2018 was the
    warmest 10-year period, with temperatures averaging 0.6°F warmer than
    during any prior decade.
  * Annual average temperatures across the state will rise 6°-10°F if
    emissions continue to increase through the year 2100; they’ll rise 2°-6°F
    if emissions begin to drop by mid-century.
  * The number of warm or very warm nights will very likely increase under
    either scenario. The number of hot or very hot days will also likely
    increase.
  * Summer heat index values will rise because of increases in absolute
    humidity.

## PRECIPITATION

  * Heavy rainfall events, dumping 3 inches or more in a day, are becoming
    more common, with the last four years seeing the greatest number of them
    since 1900.
  * It is likely that annual total precipitation will increase through the end
    of the century.
  * The frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation will very likely
    increase due to increases in atmospheric water vapor.

## SEA LEVEL RISE

  * Sea level is rising twice as fast along the state’s northern coast as
    along its southern shore. The town of Duck in the northern Outer Banks has
    seen an average rise of 1.8 inches per decade since 1978; Wilmington, in
    the south, has seen an average rise of 0.9 inches per decade since 1935.
  * It is virtually certain that sea level will continue to rise along the
    entire coast and high-tide flooding will become a nearly daily occurrence.

## HURRICANES

  * The intensity of the strongest hurricanes will increase.
  * Heavy rainfall caused by hurricanes that pass over or near North Carolina
    is very likely to increase, raising the potential for increased inland
    flooding.
  * Increased storm surge flooding is likely due to rising sea levels and the
    increasing intensity of coastal storms.

## STORMS

  * The frequency of severe thunderstorms will likely increase.
  * Total snowfall and the number of heavy snowstorms will likely decrease.

## DROUGHTS AND WILDFIRES

  * Future droughts will likely be more intense because of higher temperatures
    and increased evaporation.
  * The frequency of climate conditions conducive to wildfires will likely
    increase.

The new report was prepared by the North Carolina Institute for Climate
Studies at NC State University, in response to a request from the N.C.
Department of Environmental Quality and in support of Gov. Roy Cooper’s 2018
Executive Order 80, “North Carolina’s Commitment to Address Climate Change and
Transition to a Clean Energy Economy.”
