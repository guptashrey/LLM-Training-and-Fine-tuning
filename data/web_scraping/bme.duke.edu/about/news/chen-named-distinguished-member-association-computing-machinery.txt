# Chen Named Distinguished Member of the Association for Computing Machinery

November 7, 2018

Recognition given to those who have achieved significant accomplishments or
have made a significant impact in the field of computing, computer science, or
information technology

Yiran Chen, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke
University, has been named a Distinguished Member of the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM).

The recognition is reserved for ACM members with at least 15 years of
professional experience and five years of continuous Professional Membership
who have achieved significant accomplishments or have made a significant
impact in the field of computing, computer science, or information technology.

Chen is a new faculty member at Duke who started his position in January 2017
after serving as the Bicentennial Alumni Faculty Fellow and co-director of the
Evolutionary Intelligence Lab in the Pitt Electrical and Computer Engineering
Department. His research focuses on finding ways to create computer memory
systems that do not rely on electrons to surpass the physical density
limitations imposed by the technology and better serve modern computing
systems

Since coming to Duke, Chen has garnered a number of recognitions in the past
year alone, including being named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), receiving a Humboldt Research Fellowship for
Experienced Researchers, and being tapped to drive a new center focused on
emerging computing platforms for cognitive applications called the Alternative
Sustainable & Intelligent Computing (ASIC) consortium funded by National
Science Foundation.

outrageously ambitious
