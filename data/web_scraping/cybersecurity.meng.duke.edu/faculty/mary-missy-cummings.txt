# Mary "Missy" Cummings

Adjunct Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Mary "Missy" Cummings received her B.S. in Mathematics from the US Naval
Academy in 1988, her M.S. in Space Systems Engineering from the Naval
Postgraduate School in 1994, and her Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the
University of Virginia in 2004.  
A naval officer and military pilot from 1988-1999, she was one of the Navy's
first female fighter pilots.  
Cummings is currently a Professor in the Duke University Pratt School of
Engineering, the Duke Institute of Brain Sciences, and is the director of the
Humans and Autonomy Laboratory and Duke Robotics. Her research interests
include human-unmanned vehicle interaction, human-autonomous system
collaboration, human-systems engineering, public policy implications of
unmanned vehicles, and the ethical and social impact of technology.
