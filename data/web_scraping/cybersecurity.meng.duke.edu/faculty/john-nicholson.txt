# John H. Nicholson

Adjunct Associate Professor in the Pratt School of Engineering

Currently I serve on the Cybersecurity Masters Steering Committee in the Pratt
School of Engineering. Until the fall of 2017 I was the instructor for EGRMGMT
550 and 551, the Internship and the Internship Assessment, in the Master of
Engineering Management program. Previously I advised an independent study in
Software Engineering Management and have also developed and mentored semester-
long corporate-sponsored Consulting Practicums (EGRMGMT 556) for the program.

I continue to enjoy helping students develop professional and career enhancing
skills. The last two years I mentored an undergraduate team for the Atlantic
Council's Cyber 9/12 Student competition held at American University and
continue mentoring the Duke Cyber Team.

In 2019 I joined the board of the Center for Christianity and Scholarship at
Duke. With over 30 years experience at IBM and Lenovo in the areas of
cybersecurity, software, product management, and technology management, I have
a certification in Information Systems Security (CISSP) and my research
interests are in the area of cybersecurity technologies and strategy.
