Data Security and Privacy have taken center stage as strategic imperatives for
private companies, yet directors may not feel well-grounded in either the
technology or their understanding of external threats. This session will
discuss how boards can deepen their expertise to stay ahead of data breaches,
ransomware, and cyberthreats.
