The Sanford School of Public Policy is honored to host leading cybersecurity
reporter Sean Lyngaas for a discussion of the national security implications
of the SolarWinds hack. Sean is a 2007 graduate of Duke University where he
majored in Public Policy at the Sanford School. He then completed his Masters
in International Relations from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
Tufts University. Sean has done extensive reporting on cybersecurity breaches
and public policy and has published several detailed reports on the SolarWinds
incident. Some experts are saying that the SolarWinds attack is the most
impactful cybersecurity event in history due to its complexity and the number
of government and private sector victims. Please join Professor David Hoffman
and Visiting Scholar Bob Sullivan for a discussion of what we know about the
attack and the implications for national security and public policy.
