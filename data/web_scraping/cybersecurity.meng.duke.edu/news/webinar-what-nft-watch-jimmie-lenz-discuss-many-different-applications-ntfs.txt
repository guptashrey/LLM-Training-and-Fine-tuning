applications of NTFs.

February 22, 2022

Jimmie Lenz discusses the many different applications of NTFs.

NFT's (Non-Fungible Tokens) are possibly the most misunderstood sector of the
world of digital assets. So much more than tokenised art NFT's are likely to
see real estate, finance and fund management disrupted, assets fractionated
and shared and communities created and empowered. Join our conversation with
Jimmie Lenz, Director, Master of Engineering in FinTech and Master of
Engineering in Cybersecurity at Duke University.
