# VIDEO: Q&A with Faculty Member Mary "Missy" Cummings

November 3, 2020

The pandemic has only heightened the long-term need for expertise in
cybersecurity, Cummings says

In conversation with Jimmie Lenz: Missy Cummings, a Duke expert in human
interaction with autonomous systems

"It's great to think about designing drone systems and driverless cars," says
Mary "Missy" Cummings, Duke autonomous systems expert and faculty member of
the Duke Cybersecurity Master of Engineering program. "Yet, all of those are
eclipsed by the need in cybersecurity to figure out human issues."

During this fascinating conversation, Cummings and Lenz touch on issues of
social engineering, COVID-19's impact on human behavior and technology, fraud
detection, and data security in autonomous systems, finance and personal
digital devices—and a host of related topics.
