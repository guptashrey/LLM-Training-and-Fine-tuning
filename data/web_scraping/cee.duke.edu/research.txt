# Research

Duke CEE's research efforts focus on complex earth, water and built systems.
With collaborators around the globe, we apply engineering methods to find
solutions to significant challenges—with the goal of a healthier, safer and
more sustainable world.

## Duke CEE Research Areas

### Computational Mechanics & Scientific Computing

Developing precise algorithms to study and solve complex problems governed by
the laws of mechanics.

### Environmental Health Engineering

Studying connections between human health and ecosystem health, to understand
risks and to build resilience in both.

### Geomechanics & Geophysics for Energy and the Environment

Exploring issues in underground engineering, resource use and environmental
hazards.

### Hydrology & Fluid Dynamics

Focused on critical problems in water resources.

### Risk & Resilient Systems

Seeking new and better ways to estimate and quantify the dynamics and
uncertainty in engineered and natural systems
