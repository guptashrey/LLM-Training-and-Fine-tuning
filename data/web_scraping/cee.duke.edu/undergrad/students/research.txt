# Research & Independent Study

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Students

Undergraduate students can conduct intensive, hands-on research for academic
credit by taking independent study courses.

Independent study can qualify you for Graduation with Departmental
Distinction. Each year the Eric I. Pas Award is given to the student with the
most outstanding project.

With some planning, these courses can be a part of several of our signature
research programs described below:

## Independent Study + Research Programs

There are several programs within Pratt that give undergrads research
opportunities while earning credit. Each program offers a distinct
opportunity:

  * Pratt Undergraduate Research Fellows \- Three semesters of independent
    study, plus summer research.
  * Katsouleas NEA Grand Challenge Scholars Program \- Flexible curriculum
    focused on a societal grand challenge. Includes research, courses outside
    of engineering, and training/experience in entrepreneurship, and both a
    global and service-learning component.
  * Duke Smart Home Fellows \- One or more semesters of independent study
    focused on smart technology and/or sustainable living.

## Independent Study + You Pick the Faculty

If you decide not to pursue one of the research programs above--or just want
more flexibility for your independent study--explore the research interests of
Pratt's engineering faculty. With the right match of interests, you can work
with faculty from any department--not just faculty from your department/major.

  * The Pratt Experts List \- This list of research areas gives you
    corresponding faculty information.
  * Biomedical Engineering Faculty \- Listing of BME faculty, including those
    with appointments in the Duke School of Medicine
  * Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty \- Listing of CEE faculty,
    including those with joint appointments with the Nicholas School for the
    Environment and Earth Sciences
  * Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty \- Listing of ECE faculty
  * Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Faculty \- Listing of MEMS
    faculty

Or you can look at campus-wide research, internship or job opportunities.
DukeList includes listings of on-campus research (paid and unpaid) and
leadership opportunities for students, as well as on-campus jobs.

## Apply for Independent Study

In order to enroll in an independent study students should work with their
self-identified faculty supervisor to submit a completed Independent Study
Form to the Director of Undergraduate Studies, preferably before the end of
registration for the subsequent semester.

## CEE Independent Study Courses

### CEE 393, 394, 493, 494—Research Independent Study in CEE

Taken by junior and senior engineering students who have demonstrated an
aptitude for independent work. Consent of instructor and director of
undergraduate studies required. Half course or one course each. It is advised
that one course be completed over two semesters with 0.5 units.
