# Graduation with Departmental Distinction

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Students

Conduct supervised research as an undergraduate

Students interested in the Graduation with Department Distinction honor are
encouraged to approach faculty members to discuss independent study
opportunities.

For ideas, review the department's faculty research interests as many
independent study projects come from faculty's already funded research and
interests.

Eligibility

    

To be eligible for graduation with departmental distinction, a candidate needs
to have a 3.500 or higher GPA and complete at least one (1) unit of research
independent study, supervised by at least one of the CEE faculty, culminating
in a written report. In addition, students must present their research
projects orally to an audience of faculty and students.

Qualifying research independent study courses: CEE 393, CEE 394, CEE 493, and
CEE 494.

Process

    

The Awards and Honors Committee, through its Graduation with Departmental
Distinction coordinator, will send each student enrolled in the Graduation
with Departmental Distinction Program a letter at the beginning of the Fall
term to include:

  * A copy of the GwDD Protocol
  * The advisability of conducting the research in two terms, with a minimum ½
    course load per term,
  * The standards for the presentations and the written works, and the
    importance of the initial course description prepared by the student and
    the course instructor (submitted to the Director of Undergraduate
    Studies).

Students enrolled in the GwDD program should provide a one-page progress
report in early March to the GwDD Coordinator with a note from their Advisor
that the project is advanced enough to yield a work deserving of Distinction.

The Committee meets immediately after the oral presentations and assesses each
of the written reports and oral presentations. The Committee reports to the
Director of Undergraduate Students the names of the students eligible for
Graduation with Departmental Distinction based on the Committee's judgment of
their written and orally presented work.

Report

    

The GwDD coordinator must receive the following materials two days prior to
the oral presentation, by 5 pm ET—with presentation generally on a Friday this
would mean that the materials noted below would be due by 5 pm ET of the
previous Wednesday. If a student desires the Committee to preview their paper
and receive comments in return then the paper should be submitted to the GwDD
coordinator at least one week in advance of the oral presentation.

  * An electronic copy of the final written-work (in either .docx or .pdf
    format),
  * Digital photo(s) of the student working in the lab, at a field site,
    working at the computer, etc. which is/are suitable to publishing to a
    website (optional)

The written report needs to be prepared according to the Protocol and
following ASCE journal publication requirements. In general, the written work
may not be less than 8 nor more than 12 pages of single-spaced 10- or 12-pitch
typed text including nomenclatures, figures, tables, appendices, and
references, and it should be prepared as a photograph-ready manuscript for
conference proceedings. However, in experimental, architectural, and other
similar works the length and format may be as defined by the course
instructor.

Each report is evaluated by the Committee on the basis of correctness,
neatness, conciseness, clarity, rigor, and depth.

Presentation

    

Each student will have 15 minutes for their presentation followed by five
minutes of questions. The speakers are expected to prepare their slides
according to professional standards. The length of the presentation should be
strictly observed.

The Committee evaluates the presentation on the basis of clarity, conciseness,
and effectiveness.

Historically, oral presentations are scheduled on the last Friday of the
Spring term. The presentations are advertised to the department and typically
ordered alphabetically by the family names.

Eric I. Pas Award

    

The Committee also identifies the name of the student deemed to have
demonstrated the highest excellence in independent study as demonstrated by
the professionalism of their written or orally presented work. This student is
awarded the Eric I. Pas Award.
