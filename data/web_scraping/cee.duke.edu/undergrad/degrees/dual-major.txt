# Dual Majors

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Degrees

Civil and environmental engineering undergraduate students have the option to
pursue a dual major.

Currently, there is a specific dual major established with CE-E/W and BME.

If there is interest in other dual major options then please contact the DUS
for additional information.

## CE-E/W Track/Biomedical Engineering Dual Degree

The dual bachelor of science degree program in civil and environmental
engineering/biomedical engineering enables students with interests in
environmental and biomedical toxicology to focus on topics related to
chemistry, microbiology, genetics, and their relevance to public health. This
curriculum prepares students for careers related to both public health and the
environmental sector by emphasizing the integration of engineering, biology
and environmental sciences.

All students in this program will be advised by CEE faculty in the
environmental engineering area. The CE/BME dual major incorporates the E/W
track.

### Requirements

Completing the general and CE/BME dual requirements offer a variety of
elective choices. The minimum requirements to be met in the selection of
electives are provided below. When planning electives be cognizant of both
pre-requisites and when the course is typically offered.

Within the units there are limits of one (1) unit of physical education
activity, one (1) unit of music activity, and no (0) house courses. However,
it is possible to exceed these limits with optional electives.

### Electives

**Five (5) Humanities and Social Science (HSS) electives.** The collective
requirements to be satisfied with this minimum of five courses are

  * One (1) Social Science (SS)
  * Two (2) of the three areas of knowledge: Arts, Literature, and Performance
    (ALP), Civilizations (CZ), and Foreign Language (FL)
  * For depth, two (2) courses must be from the same department with at least
    one of those two at the 100-level, or higher.
  * Limit of two (2) AP credits may be applied

**One (1) CE elective.** Take one of the following:

  * CEE 561(242). Environmental Aquatic Chemistry
  * CEE 562(244). Biological Processes in Environmental Engineering
  * CEE 563(240). Chemical Fate of Organic Compounds
  * CEE 564(241). Physical and Chemical Treatment Processes in Environmental
    Engineering
  * CEE 571(249). Control of Hazardous and Toxic Waste
  * CEE 575(247). Air Pollution Control Engineering
  * CEE 581(245). Pollutant Transport Systems
  * CEE 661L(239L). Environmental Molecular Biotechnology
  * CEE 671(243). Physiochemical Unit Operations in Water Treatment
  * CEE 672(248). Solid Waste Engineering
  * CEE 685(246). Water Supply Engineering Design

**One (1) BME Area elective**. If BME 302L (202L) is taken, the Area Elective
must come from the Biomaterial/Biomechanics Area. If BME 307 (207) is taken,
the Area Elective must come from the Molecular, Cellular and Tissue
Engineering Area.

**One (1) Life Science elective**. Must be from the BME-approved list.

### Typical Course Sequence

This plan outlines a student's typical path to graduation by semester. Courses
in the table are required unless noted otherwise. This table also identifies
pre-requisites and co-requisites. Shifting courses to different semester
should be done with caution and preplanning. Work closely with your adviser.

**Courses in bold** are typically only offered once a year during the semester
they are shown in.

**#1** AP credit for MATH 21(31) may be used to satisfy this requirement.

**#2** AP credit for MATH 22(32) may be used to satisfy this requirement. If
AP credit for 21(31) but not 22(32) then take MATH 122L(41L) in Freshman Fall.

**#4** As part of the PHYSICS 151L(61L) & 152L(62L) requirement at least one
of 152L(62L), 153L(63L), or 264(143) must be taken at Duke regardless of AP
credit. If AP credit for 141L(61) and 142L(62) then take 153L(63L) or
264(143), OR you may waive AP credit for 142L(62) and take 152L(62L) but you
may NOT waive AP credit for 141L(61) and take 151L(61L) while also maintaining
AP credit for 142L(62). In other words, if you waive AP credit for 141L(61)
then you must take both 151L(61L) and 152L(62L) at Duke.

**#7** It is advised that any electives taken in the first year advance the
completion of the humanities and social science (HSS) requirements.
