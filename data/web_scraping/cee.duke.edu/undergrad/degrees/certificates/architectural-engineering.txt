Learn from a practicing architect and experience hands-on design

### Hands-On Projects

See photos and learn more

The curriculum for this certificate provides:

  * An understanding of the building design and construction processes
  * A close-up examination of current construction projects
  * Hands-on projects that simulate work as a member of a professional design
    team

A background in aesthetic design, architectural history, building materials,
and construction forms the architectural core the coursework, while a suitable
list of engineering courses in such topics as the structural design provides
an engineering basis.

Students working toward Duke's **Certificate in Architectural Engineering**
learn from a practicing architect—Chris Brasier, a fellow of the American
Institute of Architects.
