) outlines a typical, semester-by-semester path to graduation. Students who
have already matriculated should consult the CEE Undergraduate Handbook as
degree requirements can differ by matriculation date. Courses in the table are
required unless noted otherwise. Shifting courses to a different semester
should be done with caution and preplanning due, in part, to prerequisites and
co-requisites.

**NOTE:** Course numbers in **bold** (e.g., **CEE 132L** ) are typically only
offered once a year during the semester shown.

## Electives

Completing the general engineering and departmental requirements offer a
variety of elective choices. Below you will find the minimum elective
requirements for CEE students. When planning electives be cognizant of both
pre-requisites and when the course is typically offered.

### Five (5) Social Science and Humanities (SS/H) electives

These courses, from the areas of Arts, Literature, and Performance (ALP),
Civilizations (CZ), Foreign Language (FL), and Social Science (SS), must meet
the following minimum requirements.

  * One (1) Social Science (SS)
  * Two (2) of the three areas: ALP, CZ, and FL
  * For depth, two (2) courses must be from the same department with at least
    one of those two at the 200-level (100-level), or higher.
  * Limit of two (2) AP credits

EI Code requirement: Of the 34 units required for graduation, at least one of
the units must possess the EI (Ethical Inquiry) code. Most likely this EI code
will be possessed by one of these 5 SS/H courses.

### CEE Elective(s)

Two (2) electives. These must be upper-level CEE courses; an upper-level

requirement include, but are not limited to:

Course Number Course Title  
CEE 311 Architectural Engineering I  
CEE 315-20 Engr. Sustainable Design and the Global Comm.: Structural Focus

### Two (2) Unrestricted Electives

Two (2) electives. These electives are unrestricted with the exception that at
most 1.0 units of physical education activity and at most 1.0 units of music
activity can be used to meet BSE requirements. House courses cannot be used.

### Optional Electives

Students may exceed the minimum of 34 units required for the BSE degree. This
may be accomplished via AP credits, overloading, and/or summer courses either
at Duke or elsewhere.

* * *

## Study Abroad

With a little planning, the Duke CEE curriculum affords any student the
opportunity to study abroad in the Junior Fall semester. Students are always
able to pursue study abroad during the summer semester.

Many popular institutions for study-abroad offer technical courses that are
pre-approved for Duke CEE requirements. Alternatively, students can modify the
typical course sequence in order to take humanities electives when they are
abroad.

For study abroad in the Junior Fall without any engineering courses, which is
not necessary depending on the institution selected, you may:

  * Move fluid mechanics (CEE 301L) to Sophomore Spring. Note that CEE 301L
    has co-requisites of MATH 353 and EGR 244L, which are easily met if you
    have AP credit for MATH 21. CEE 301L will need to be offered on Tu-Th
    mornings in Spring semesters
  * Move systems optimization & economics (EGR 305) to Senior Fall
  * S/M Track: Move matrix structural analysis (CEE 421L) to Senior Fall
  * E/W Track: Move aquatic chemistry (CEE 461L) to Senior Fall
