Sally Kleberg Distinguished Professor of Environmental Toxicology

Dr. Di Giulio serves as Director of Duke University's Integrated Toxicology
Program and the Superfund Basic Research Center. Dr. Di Giulio's research is
concerned with basic studies of mechanisms of contaminant metabolism,
adaptation and toxicity, and with the development of mechanistically-based
indices of exposure and toxicity that can be employed in biomonitoring. The
long term goals of this research are to bridge the gap between mechanistic
toxicological research and the development of useful tools for environmental
assessment, and to elucidate linkages between human and ecosystem health. The
bulk of Dr. Di Giulio's work employs a comparative approach with aquatic
animals, particularly fishes, as models. Of particular concern are mechanisms
of oxidative metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons, mechanisms of free radical
production and antioxidant defense, and mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis,
developmental perturbations and adaptations to contaminated environments by
fishes.
