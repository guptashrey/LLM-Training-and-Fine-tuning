Theodore S. Coile Distinguished Professor of Hydrology and Micrometeorology

**Gabriel G. Katul** received his B.E. degree in 1988 at the American
University of Beirut (Beirut, Lebanon), his M.S. degree in 1990 at Oregon
State University (Corvallis, OR) and his Ph.D degree in 1993 at the University
of California in Davis (Davis, CA). He is currently the Theodore S. Coile
Professor __of Hydrology and Micrometeorology at the Nicholas School of the
Environment and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Duke
University (Durham, NC). He was a visiting fellow at University of Virginia
(USA) in 1997, the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization
(Australia) in 2002, the University of Helsinki (Finland) in 2009, the
FulBright-Italy Distinguished Fellow at Politecnico di Torino (Italy) in 2010,
the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) in 2013, Nagoya
University (Japan) in 2014, University of Helsinki (Finland) in 2017, the
Karlsruher Institute for Technology (Germany) in 2017, and Princeton
University (USA) in 2020. He received several honorary awards, including an
honorary certificate by La Seccion de Agrofisica de la Sociedad Cubana de
Fisica in Habana (in 1998), the Macelwane medal and became thereafter a fellow
of the American Geophysical Union (in 2002), editor’s citation for excellence
in refereeing from the American Geophysical Union (in 2008), the Hydrologic
Science Award from the American Geophysical Union (in 2012), the John Dalton
medal from the European Geosciences Union (in 2018), and the Outstanding
Achievements in Biometeorology Award from the American Meteorological Society
(in 2021). He served as the Secretary General for the Hydrologic Science
Section at the American Geophysical Union (2006-2008). Research in Katul's lab
focuses on micro-meteorology and near-surface hydrology with emphasis on heat,
momentum, carbon dioxide, water vapor, ozone, particulate matter (including
aerosols, pollen, and seeds) and water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
system as well as their implications to a plethora of hydrological,
ecological, atmospheric and climate change related problems.
