Ronie-Richele Garcia-Johnson Distinguished Professor

Professor Heather Stapleton is an environmental chemist and exposure scientist
in the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University. Her research
interests focus on identification of halogenated and organophosphate chemicals
in building materials, furnishings and consumer products, and estimation of
human exposure, particularly in vulnerable populations such as pregnant women
and children. Her laboratory utilizes mass spectrometry, including targeted
and nontargeted approaches, to characterize chemical burdens in both
environmental samples and biological tissues to support environmental health
research. Currently she serves as the Director for the Duke Superfund Research
Center, and Director of the Duke Environmental Analysis Laboratory, which is
part of NIH’s Human Health Environmental Analysis Resource.
