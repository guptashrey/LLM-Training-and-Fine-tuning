Professor of the Practice in Civil and Environmental Engineering

Joe Nadeau earned his B.S. in Civil Engineering from Lehigh University in
1989, and then continued his education and earned a S.M. in Civil Engineering
in 1991 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then matriculated
to the University of California at Berkeley where he earned his Ph.D., in
Civil and Environmental Engineering in 1996.

Dr. Nadeau’s primary research focus is in the areas of theoretical and applied
mechanics, micromechanics, composite materials, and probabilistic methods.
