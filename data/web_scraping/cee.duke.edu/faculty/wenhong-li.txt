Associate Professor of Climate

Dr. Li's research interests focus primarily on climate dynamics, land-
atmosphere interaction, hydroclimatology, and climate modeling. Her current
research is to understand how the hydrological cycle changes in the current
and future climate and their impacts on the ecosystems, subtropical high
variability and change, unforced global temperature variability, and climate
and health issues.
