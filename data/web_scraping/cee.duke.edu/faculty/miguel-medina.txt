Profesor Emeritus of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Dr. Medina earned a Ph.D. degree in water resources and environmental
engineering sciences from the University of Florida in 1976 and joined the
Duke faculty thereafter. Dr. Medina is Director of the International Honors
Program of the Pratt School of Engineering. He has been a registered
Professional Hydrologist, American Institute of Hydrology (Minnesota), since
1983, and its current President-Elect. Dr. Medina is Associate Editor of the
Journal of Hydrologic Engineering.

Professor Medina has conducted funded research in hydrologic and water quality
mathematical modeling for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the
National Science Foundation, the Office of Water Research and Technology, the
North Carolina Water Resources Research Institute, the State of North
Carolina, the U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station, the Naval Oceanographic
Office, the U.S. Air Force, DuPont Engineering, and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Energy in joint ventures with Luna
Innovations. His current research focuses on contaminant transport hydrology,
specifically modeling flow and mass transport across surface/subsurface
interfaces and interactions. The results of his research are reported in such
journals as Water Resources Research, Journal of Contaminant Hydrology,
Journal of Hydrology, Hydrosoft, Advances in Water Resources, Ground Water,
Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, Applied
Mathematics and Computation, Journal of the American Water Resources
Association, Computing in Civil Engineering, Journal of Water Resources
Planning and Management, Desalination, Journal of Environmental Engineering,
Hydrological Science and Technology, and Environmental Health Perspectives.

He was selected a Fulbright Scholar for 1984 at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia. He conducted post-graduate intensive courses on urban hydrology for
UNESCO in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the Dominican
Republic, and Panama in 1985 and 1986. In 1987, he was awarded an NSF travel
grant to establish links between U.S. and Argentine hydrologists and water
professionals. He was named External Evaluator of the UNESCO International
Hydrological Programme from 2002 to 2003. He was selected the Lead Evaluator
in 2007 of the UNESCO World Water Assessment Program.

Professor Medina is a former President of the Universities Council on Water
Resources, Inc., and the North Carolina Section of the American Water
Resources Association. He is a consultant to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the World Health Organization, the Research Triangle Institute of
North Carolina, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Pan American Health
Organization, the Ministries of Water Resources in Venezuela and Spain, the
Technical Advisory Service for Attorneys, and other private enterprises. He is
a former Chairman of the International Technical Advisory Committee of the
International Ground Water Modeling Center (Colorado School of Mines, and
Delft, The Netherlands). In 1989, the Governor of North Carolina appointed Dr.
Medina to the Environmental Management Commission.
