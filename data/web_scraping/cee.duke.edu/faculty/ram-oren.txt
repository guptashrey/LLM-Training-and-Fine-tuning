Nicholas Distinguished Professor of Earth Systems Science

With his graduate students, Oren quantifies components of the water cycle in
forest ecosystems, and their responses to biotic and abiotic factors. Relying
on the strong links between the carbon and water cycles, he also studies the
components of the carbon flux and their response to these factors. Climate
variability, including variations in air temperature, vapor pressure deficit,
incoming radiation and soil moisture, and environmental change, including
elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, affect the intra- and inter-annual
dynamics, and amounts of water used by forest ecosystems, and their spatial
distribution, as well as carbon uptake and sequestration. In turn, the
variation of water flux influence the temporal and spatial partitioning of
incoming radiation between latent and sensible heat. The flow of water from
soil through plant leaves into the atmosphere, and the exchange of water for
CO2 absorbed from the atmospheric, are among the processes theoretically best
understood in plant and ecosystem physiology. Using these theories, local mass
balance approaches, and detailed measurements of water and carbon flux and
driving variables in the soil, plants, and the atmosphere, Oren has been
attempting to predict the likely responses of forest ecosystems, from the
equator to the arctic circle, to environmental change and management.
