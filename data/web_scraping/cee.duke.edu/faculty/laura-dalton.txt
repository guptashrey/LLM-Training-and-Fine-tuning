Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Professor Dalton joined Duke University in August 2022 after obtaining her PhD
from North Carolina State University, MS and BS from West Virginia University.
Dr. Dalton is an experimentalist and her research interests include studying
and understanding reactive, multiphase transport in porous media. She is
particularly interested in understanding and manipulating chemical and
physical processes that occur during reactive, multiphase transport in both
engineered (cementitious) and natural (geological) porous materials. To this
end, she uses quantitative imaging approaches such as X-ray computed
tomography (CT), neutron tomography, and electrical imaging modalities
including electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). She is interested in using
hybrid and simultaneous imaging modalities because complementary and temporal
information can be obtained using these approaches to better understand
complex processes such as developing innovative methods to sequester CO2.
