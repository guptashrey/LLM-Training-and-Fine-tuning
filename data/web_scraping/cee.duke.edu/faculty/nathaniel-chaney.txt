Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Prior to arriving at Duke, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the
program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University and had a
dual appointment as a visiting research scientist at the NOAA Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. I obtained my undergraduate degree at U.C. Berkeley
where I received a Bachelor of Arts in Atmospheric Sciences and Applied
Mathematics. For my graduate studies, I attended Princeton University where I
completed a Ph.D. in Hydrology in the department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering.

My research harnesses the existing petabytes of global environmental data to
improve understanding of the terrestrial water cycle. More specifically, I
focus on quantifying and uncovering the role of multi-scale spatial
organization over land (i.e., heterogeneity) in the Earth system. To this end,
my group's research has three overarching themes: 1) improve the
representation of land heterogeneity in Earth system models, 2) harness
environmental data to characterize the observed spatial patterns and features
over land, and 3) quantify the sensitivity of the hydrologic cycle to spatial
heterogeneity. The tools that my group uses include numerical modeling,
satellite remote sensing, machine learning, and high performance computing.  
  
I am currently looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and postdocs. If the
research themes of my group are of interest to you, please don't hesitate to
email me.
