Associate Professor of Environmental Genomics in the Division of Environmental
Sciences and Policy

Dr. Meyer studies the effects of toxic agents and stressors on human and
wildlife health. He is particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms
by which environmental agents cause DNA damage, the molecular processes that
organisms employ to protect prevent and repair DNA damage, and genetic
differences that may lead to increased or decreased sensitivity to DNA damage.
Mitochondrial DNA damage and repair, as well as mitochondrial function in
general, are a particular focus. He studies these effects in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, in cell culture, and collaboratively in other
laboratory model organisms as well as in human populations in the USA and
globally.
