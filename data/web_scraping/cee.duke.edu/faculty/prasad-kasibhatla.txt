Professor in the Division of Environmental Sciences and Policy

The overarching theme of my research is to develop a fundamental and
quantitative understanding of the factors that determine the chemical
composition of the atmosphere. I am particularly interested in delineating
natural and anthropogenic impacts on the chemical composition of the
atmosphere, and in exploring the potential for these impacts to affect natural
ecosystems. My research involves the use of numerical models in conjunction
with remote and insitu measurements of atmospheric composition.
