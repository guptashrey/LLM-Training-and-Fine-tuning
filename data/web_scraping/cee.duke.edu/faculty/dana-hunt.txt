Associate Professor of Microbial Ecology

My research focus is on understanding the ecology of microbes through
examination of their genes and lifestyles. Bacteria are the most diverse
organisms on earth and play a pivotal role in planetary cycling of nutrients
and energy. Yet, we have a poor understanding of the factors that drive their
diversity and dynamics in the environment. The lab's emphasis is on studying
bacterial interactions with the environment at the appropriate temporal and
spatial scale including the effect of temperature changes on bacterial
populations and bacterial interactions with other organisms. Another area of
active research is the response and adaptation of bacteria to emerging
pollutants such as antibiotics and nanoparticles.
