Aleksander S. Vesic Distinguished Professor Emeritus

Henry Petroski received his bachelor's degree from Manhattan College and his
Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before coming to
Duke in 1980, he had taught at the University of Illinois and the University
of Texas at Austin and was a group leader at Argonne National Laboratory,
where he was responsible for research and development efforts in fracture
mechanics. He is a professional engineer registered in Texas, and a chartered
engineer registered in Ireland. At Duke, he has a secondary appointment as a
professor of history. From 2004 through 2012 he held a Presidential
appointment as a member of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board.

Professor Petroski's current research activity focuses on the
interrelationship between success and failure in design. He also has a strong
interest in the nature of invention and in the history of technology. His
research has been sponsored by the Corps of Engineers, the National Science
Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and other organizations. He has
published, in addition to nineteen books and hundreds of articles in
newspapers, magazines, and trade journals, over seventy-five refereed journal
articles in such places as International Journal of Fracture, Engineering
Fracture Mechanics, Journal of Applied Mechanics, Structural Safety, and
Research in Engineering Design.

Professor Petroski is author of the book, To Engineer Is Human: The Role of
Failure in Successful Design (1985), and is the writer and presenter of the
1987 BBC-television documentary, "To Engineer Is Human," which has been
broadcast on PBS. He is also the author of The Pencil: A History of Design and
Circumstance (1990), The Evolution of Useful Things (1992), Design Paradigms:
Case Histories of Error and Judgment in Engineering (1994), Engineers of
Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and The Spanning of America (1995), Invention by
Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing (1996), Remaking the World:
Adventures in Engineering (1997), The Book on the Bookshelf (1999), Paperboy:
Confessions of a Future engineer (2002), Small Things Considered: Why There Is
No Perfect Design (2003), Pushing the Limits: New Adventures in Engineering
(2004), Success through Failure: The Paradox of Design (2006), The Toothpick:
Technology and Culture (2007), The Essential Engineer: Why Science Alone Will
Not Solve Our Global Problems (2010), An Engineer's Alphabet: Gleanings from
the Softer Side of a Profession (2011), To Forgive Design: Understanding
Failure (2012), The House with Sixteen Handmade Doors: A Tale of Architectural
Choice and Craftsmanship (2014), and The Road Taken: The History and Future of
America's Infrastructure (2016). He writes the engineering column for American
Scientist and a column on the profession for ASEE Prism. He also lectures
widely and is interviewed frequently on radio and television.

Among his honors are a Guggenheim Fellowship (1990-1991); honorary degrees
from Clarkson University (1990), Trinity College (1997), Valparaiso University
(1999), Manhattan College (2003), Missouri University of Science and
Technology (2011), and McGill University (2016); the Ralph Coats Roe Medal
from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1991), the Civil
Engineering History and Heritage Award from the American Society of Civil
Engineers (1993), the Washington Award from the Western Society of Engineers
(2006), the John P. McGovern Award for Science from the Cosmos Club Foundation
(2014), among others. He is the recipient of a Centennial Award as an
Outstanding Engineering Graduate of Manhattan College (1992) and an Alumni
Award for Distinguished Service from the College of Engineering of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1994). Professor Petroski is a
Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, a fellow of
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Engineers
of Ireland, and is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the U.S. National Academy of
Engineering.
