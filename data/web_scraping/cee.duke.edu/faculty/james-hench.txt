Associate Professor of Oceanography

Research in my lab focuses on fluid dynamics in the coastal ocean and its
effects on transport processes. We use field measurements, computational
models, and theoretical analyses to understand fundamental physical processes
in these systems. We also work extensively on interdisciplinary problems that
have a significant physical component to better understand the effects of
water motion on the geochemistry, biology, and ecology of shallow marine
systems.  
  
Much of our research is on coral reef hydrodynamics and our lab leads the
Physical Oceanographic component of the Moorea Coral Reef LTER project  
  
Current projects include: 1) wave-driven circulation and exchange in coral
reef, lagoon, and pass systems; 2) extreme events and their effects on coral
reef systems; 3) understanding the effects of rough bottoms such as corals on
circulation and scalar mixing; 4) the impact of stratification on vertical
mixing in a highly stratified wind-driven estuary; 5) larval transport around
a coral reef island; 6) sponge excurrents; and 7) the effects of wave forcing
on corallivory.
