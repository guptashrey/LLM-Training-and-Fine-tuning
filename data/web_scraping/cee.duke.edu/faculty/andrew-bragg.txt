Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Dr. Andrew D. Bragg’s research focuses on fundamental and applied problems in
fluid dynamics, especially turbulence.

Particular problems include understanding the microphysical processes
governing rain formation in clouds and their implications for global climate,
the mixing of organisms in the ocean, water treatment, and the dispersion of
pollution in the atmosphere, along with astrophysical and industrial problems.
His approach to solving these problems combines methods from applied
mathematics and statistical physics, along with high-performance computation.
Recent interests also include ecohydrology, porous media flows and geophysical
fluid dynamics.

Before joining the Duke University faculty, Dr. Bragg was a postdoctoral
associate in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral associate in
the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Cornell
University. Dr. Bragg obtained his PhD in Theoretical Fluid Dynamics from
Newcastle University in England.
