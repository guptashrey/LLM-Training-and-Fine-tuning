Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Fred Boadu received his B.S. (Hons) in geological engineering from the
University of Science and Technology, Ghana, a Post-Graduate Diploma in
applied geophysics from McGill University, an M.S. in geophysics from the
University of Calgary, and his Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology in
1994. He was an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Science and
Technology, School of Mines (Tarkwa, Ghana) from 1982 to 1984. Since 1986, he
has worked for several oil companies (Chevron, Amoco, and Mobil) during the
summer months on a variety of research projects. He is also a consultant for
Texaco, Inc. and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation.

Dr. Boadu’s research focuses on the areas of exploration, engineering and
environmental geophysics. Current research involves characterizing the
transport and storage properties of porous media such as fractured rocks,
soils and human tissue. The work involves modeling, laboratory and field
experiments. Fractal concepts and neural networks are used to interpret
results. Recently, Dr. Boadu has been involved in research regarding nitrate
contamination in groundwater, and as well, in education and awareness campaign
of the implications in potential health hazards in Ghana

## Education

  * Ph.D. Georgia Institute of Technology, 1994

## Research Interests

How the engineering, environmental and petrophysical properties of porous
media (soils, fractured rock, biological tissues) affect measurable
geophysical responses, and subsequently develop methodologies by which these
properties can be obtained from non-invasive geophysical measurements.
