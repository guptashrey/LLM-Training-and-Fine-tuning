Anderson-Rupp Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Wilkins Aquino obtained a BSCE from Purdue University, and a MS and PhD in
Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before
joining the Duke Faculty, he was an associate professor in the School of Civil
and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. He was also a member of
the fields of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Applied Mathematics at
Cornell. Prof. Aquino has broad interests in computational mechanics,
including finite element methods, computational inverse problems, uncertainty
quantification, coupled chemo-mechanics, and computational acoustics, among
others.
