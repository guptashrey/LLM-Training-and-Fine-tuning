# Students Advocating for Graduate Education (SAGE)

The Students Advocating for Graduate Education (SAGE) committee is composed of
graduate Civil and Environmental Engineering students across each study track.
Members of SAGE are personally nominated from their respective lab groups,
which helps make SAGE an inclusive representation of the department.

SAGE is also closely connected with other groups such as Pratt's Engineering
Graduate Student Council and Duke's Graduate and Professional Student Council.

## What We Do

SAGE plans many of the department dinners, recruitment events, and educational
seminars. Examples include the annual Holiday Dinner Party, a seminar
dedicated to student elevator talks, and a CEE-specific culture survey.

We also work to strengthen the student faculty relationship outside of the
work setting by hosting fun outings in Durham. In addition to event planning,
SAGE works as a transparent voice among students, faculty, and administration.
We strive to ensure that individual needs as graduate students are being
satisfied, and if not, identifying how to fix the situation.

If you would like to contact SAGE please do so by sending us an email at the
link below and we will gladly respond.
