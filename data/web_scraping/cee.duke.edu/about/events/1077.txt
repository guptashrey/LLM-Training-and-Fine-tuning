Abstract:  
Artificial intelligence (AI) may capture the properties and functions of
materials better than previous theoretical/computational methods because it
targets correlations and does not assume an underlying physical model.
However, the statistical analysis and interpretation require careful
attention.  
In this talk I will discuss recently developed, explainable AI methods [1,2]
and applications [3-5] that combine detailed, consistent experimental data
(called "clean data") with theoretical data for the identification of "rules"
that determine the properties and functions of materials. These "rules" depend
on descriptive parameters, called "materials genes". In analogy to genes in
biology they are correlated with a certain material property or function.
Thus, these materials genes help the identification of materials that are, for
example, better electrical conductors or better heat insulators or better
catalysts.
