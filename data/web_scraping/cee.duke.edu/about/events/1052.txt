## Presenter

Eric R. Pardyjak, professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Adjunct Professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of
Utah

Spatial heterogeneity of the earth's surface is a complexity that confounds
both measurement and modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer, particularly
at scales ranging from about a meter to several hundreds of meters. In this
presentation, I will discuss results from the Idealized Planar Array Study for
Quantifying Surface heterogeneity (IPAQS), which was conducted over the very
flat desert playa in western Utah. While this desert surface is extremely
smooth and uniform aerodynamically, significant near-surface soil moisture and
surface temperature variabilities play an important role in how heat is
transferred to and from the atmosphere and have important implications on the
closure of the surface energy balance. Surprisingly, often neglected terms
related to advection can play a significant role in heat transport. Using
IPAQS data and idealized simulations in conjunction with scaling analysis, we
have derived a non-dimensional number that appears to help explain the role of
surface heterogeneity on turbulent transport in the surface layer.
