Presented annually to the best student paper on finite element analysis

Robert J. Melosh

Since 1989, the Robert J. Melosh Medal Competition has provided a forum for
young engineers and researchers to present their work to and interact with
leaders in the field of computational mechanics.

The award honors Prof. Melosh—a pioneering researcher in finite element
methods and former chair of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Duke. The
Melosh Medal was established in view of his body of work, and aims to reflect
his dedication to the education of engineers.

Winners receive the Robert J. Melosh Medal and a $500 honorarium. Their names
are inscribed on a plaque displayed in Hudson Hall.
