  3. Awards & Honors

Presented to the graduating civil engineering senior judged to have conducted
the most outstanding independent study project

Eric I. Pas

This award was established in 1998 in memory of Eric I. Pas, a beloved faculty
member who served as director of undergraduate studies in civil and
environmental engineering at Duke.

Pas was an internationally recognized researcher in the activity-based
modeling approach to travel demand analysis. He died in 1997 at age 49.

The names of recipients of this award are inscribed on a plaque displayed in
Hudson Hall.
