Presented annually to the best pre-PhD peer-reviewed journal papers

Senol Utku

The Senol Utku Annual Awards recognize graduate student/faculty adviser teams
for intellectual excellence, creativity, and highest-quality work.

The competition promotes early writing of research articles among graduate
students by selecting the best pre-Ph.D. peer-reviewed journal papers.

The awards are dedicated to Senol Utku for his exemplary academic achievements
and years of service to the department, 1970-2002.
