Presented annually in recognition of demonstrated academic excellence,
interest, and enthusiasm in the study of environmental engineering

Duke Archives

William Brewster Snow, a widely respected and influential sanitation engineer,
was a native of Durham, N.C. and member of the Class of 1932—among the first
to earn an engineering degree from Duke.

He served on the faculty of Duke's College of Engineering from 1948-53.

Active in public life, he was a founder of the series of conferences that
guided implementation of North Carolina's Stream Sanitation Law, passed in
1951.

The names of recipients of this award are inscribed on a plaque displayed in
Hudson Hall.
