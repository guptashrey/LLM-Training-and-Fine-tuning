## Annual Robert J. Melosh Medal Competition  
for the Best Student Paper on Finite Element Analysis

### Sponsored by

  * Duke University Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering
  * Elsevier

and

### Endorsed by

  * The International Association for Computational Mechanics

**[Background | Format | Past Judges | Scope | Submission Procedure | Links |
Dates | Contact]**

### Background

The Robert J. Melosh Medal Competition was inaugurated in 1989 to honor the
pioneering researcher in finite element methods and former chairman of the
Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Duke University.

In a professional career that included work at Boeing, Philco-Ford Laboratory,
and MARC Analysis and Research Corporation, as well as teaching at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, University of Washington, Virginia Tech, and Duke,
Prof. Melosh made significant and varied contributions to the finite element
method.

The Competition was established in view of this body of work and aims to
reflect Prof. Melosh's dedication to the education of young engineers and
researchers by providing a forum for student researchers to present their work
and interact with each other and with leading researchers in the field.

The winner of the Competition, as determined on the basis of a submitted
extended abstract and an oral presentation of the paper, receives the Robert
J. Melosh Medal and a $500 honorarium.

### Competition Format

The Competition is conducted in two phases:

  * **Abstract Review:** Extended abstracts are reviewed by a panel of
    distinguished researchers in computational mechanics. The top six papers
    are selected as finalists
  * **Symposium Talks:** The student authors are invited to participate in a
    symposium held at Duke University (in accordance with Duke’s public health
    guidelines). The symposium features talks by all six finalists, as well as
    lectures by the members of the distinguished judging panel

### Scope

Submissions are invited in all areas of finite element analysis, including:

  * Theoretical development
  * Implementational procedure
  * Programming aspects
  * Novel and innovative applications
  * Integration of finite elements into the design process

Additionally, submissions in related areas of computational mechanics (e.g.,
boundary elements, meshless methods) will also be welcomed, particularly where
the technical contribution of interest may be expected to enhance our
understanding of finite element procedures.

Prospective topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Solid and Structural Mechanics
  * Computational Fluid Mechanics
  * Stochastic Problems
  * Geomechanics
  * Mesh Generation, Refinement and Adaptivity
  * Meshfree Methods
  * Nonlinear Dynamics
  * Scientific Visualization
  * Finite Elements in CAD, CAM and CAE
  * Biomechanics
  * Parallel Computing and FEM
  * FEM in Environmental Science and Environmental Engineering
  * Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering

### Submission Procedure

Each paper must have as its first-named author a student or a recent student
no more than one year beyond graduation. It is expected that most submissions
will describe Master's- or PhD-level work. However, truly exceptional work
done by undergraduate researchers will also be welcomed. Submitted papers
should be in extended abstract format, three to five pages in length
(including all graphics). Although the page limit will prevent the
presentation of extended theoretical development, enough detail should be
included to allow a reasonable assessment of technical merit.

  * For submissions via regular mail, four copies should be submitted: one (1)
    with a cover page indicating title, author and affiliation, and three (3)
    copies with the title but no authors or affiliations indicated
  * For electronic submissions (preferred), only one (1) copy of each is
    required
  * Documents prepared using LaTeX with the Elsevier LaTeX class file
    **elsartarticle.cls** , are preferred. LaTeX instructions and a link to
    download the class file template are available from Elsevier at this
    webpage »
