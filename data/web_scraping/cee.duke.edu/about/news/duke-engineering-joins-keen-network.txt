# Duke Engineering Joins KEEN Network

February 5, 2019

National network promotes 'entrepreneurial mindset' in engineering education

Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering has become the newest member of
KEEN, the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network—a national partnership of
engineering faculty focused on developing and promoting innovation in
engineering education for the good of society.

KEEN is an expanding network of more than three dozen partner institutions
across the United States with a shared vision of equipping engineering
students with not only technical skills but an “entrepreneurial mindset.”

“At Duke Engineering, we encourage students to envision a better state, a
better way, a better future—and then help them develop the confidence and
skills to bring that vision to fruition,” said Ravi V. Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean
of Engineering. “That’s what the entrepreneurial mindset is all about, and
it’s why we see Duke Engineering and KEEN as natural partners.”

The mindset isn’t focused on founding companies—as KEEN defines it, the goal
is fostering curiosity and creativity, and teaching engineers to “understand
the bigger picture, recognize opportunities, evaluate markets, and learn from
mistakes to create value for themselves and others.”

By providing a national platform for engineering faculty to share relevant
best practices, course content modules and pedagogical innovations, the
network seeks to prepare young engineers to make significant impacts in the
world.

“We’re excited about Duke joining the national network of KEEN partners,” said
Doug Melton, director of the Entrepreneurial Engineering Program at the Kern
Family Foundation, which sponsors KEEN. “Through their co-creative work in
KEEN, Duke is preparing the next generation of engineers, better than ever, to
identify opportunities that create significant, positive, scalable impact.”

As part of the network, Duke will benefit from the knowledge of network
partners and share lessons learned from its own innovations.

Recently, for example, Duke Engineering has transformed its undergraduate
curriculum, “flipping” the typical model. Students are immersed in hands-on
design, data science, computing, research and entrepreneurship from the very
beginning. Traditionally, engineering students took three or more semesters of
mostly science and mathematics courses before studying engineering topics.

In just one part of the experience, all Duke Engineering first-year students
take a design course where they prototype their own solutions to authentic
engineering problems.

The design challenges come from campus and community partners. One recent
example is a cart fitted with shock absorbers that safely transports fragile
texts within Duke’s Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library.

Experiencing firsthand how engineers can make a difference in the world sparks
inspiration and excitement in new students, and more. Research suggests
introducing design courses in the first year can enhance student self-
efficacy—a confidence in one’s abilities. Self-efficacy can be crucial to a
student staying with an engineering major in later years when the material
becomes more complex and challenges mount.

“Our faculty has much to share, from our client-based first-year projects to
our innovations in teaching computer programming,” said Ann Saterbak, director
of Duke Engineering’s First-Year Experience and a nationally recognized leader
in engineering education. “KEEN will also be an amazing resource to learn from
our peers all across the country.”

Saterbak and fellow engineering faculty members Martin Brooke (ECE) and Mark
Palmeri (BME) will co-lead the KEEN initiative at Duke. Next steps include
introducing faculty to the array of KEEN resources and developing a plan to
integrate the entrepreneurial mindset into student experiences across all four
years of the engineering curriculum.
