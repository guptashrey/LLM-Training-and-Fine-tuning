# General Milley Visits Duke Engineering Labs, Faculty and Students

November 15, 2021

The nation’s highest-ranking military officer heard pitches, saw design
projects and talked security during a visit to the Wilkinson Building

General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
nation’s highest-ranking military officer, visited Duke’s campus on Friday,
November 12. While on campus, Milley spoke as part of the Ambassador Dave and
Kay Phillips Family International Lecture Series, met with ROTC units and
visited laboratories that are conducting research with funding from the
Department of Defense.

During a tour through Duke Engineering’s new Wilkinson Building, Milley heard
pitches from Duke Design Defense students working on an online hub to help
with training efficiencies, viewed a Duke Design Health team’s novel
tourniquet prototype, and participated in roundtable discussions on assured
autonomy with Miroslav Pajic (ECE); artificial intelligence with Robert
Calderbank (ECE) and Stefano Curtarolo (MEMS); and quantum computing with
ECE's Chris Monroe, Jungsang Kim and Ken Brown.

Curtarolo was also able to discuss his newly awarded pinnacle Department of
Defense High-Performance-Computer Frontier grant, which carries with it 1/3
billion supercomputer hours (worth more than $30 million if they were instead
acquired from web-services or supported by Duke facilities) to study ultra-
high-temperature disordered ceramics for hypersonic technologies.

For more on Milley’s comments while on campus, read the story about his visit
from Duke Today. To learn more about Milley’s visit to Duke Engineering
teaching and research laboratories, check out the photos and captions below.
