Rate of Change is a new podcast from Duke Engineering, dedicated to the
ingenious ways that engineers are solving society's toughest problems.

## Listen

## Transcript

Mike Bergin: Currently, we know very little about air pollution's overall
impact on solar energy production.

David Katz: The HIV virus was starting to take its toll in the United States.

Cynthia Rudin: There's sort of a widespread belief that because a model is a
black box, it's more accurate.

Nenad Bursac: We are making a regenerative—or, trying to make self-healing
muscle from human tissues.

Po-Chun Hsu: What if we put our effort into textiles-- how much could we
achieve?

M. Volborth: Air pollution, HIV transmission, black box algorithms, engineered
tissue and smarter textiles. We're discussing them all in season one of Rate
of Change, a new podcast from Duke Engineering. Visit pratt.duke.edu/podcast.
