# Fifteen Earn National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships

September 10, 2018

Highly competitive national awards will help 14 new and returning Duke
Engineering graduate students conduct research on campus

Each year, the Pratt School of Engineering encourages graduate students to
seek support from external fellowship awards. Earning these competitive
fellowships goes a long way toward helping emerging scientists conduct their
research while raising Duke Engineering’s profile and research portfolio in
turn.

This year, new and returning Duke Engineering graduate students manage to nab
15 fellowships from the National Science Foundation (NSF).

The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program is the oldest graduate fellowship
of its kind in the United States, with a long history of selecting recipients
who achieve high levels of success in their future academic and professional
careers. This competitive fellowship program recognizes and supports
outstanding graduate students who pursue research-based master's and doctoral
degrees at accredited United States institutions of higher learning.

“The NSF Graduate Research Fellowships are part of a highly competitive
national program,” said Jennifer West, the Fitzpatrick Family University
Professor of Engineering and Associate Dean for Ph.D. Education at Duke. “It
is gratifying to see the talent and hard work of our exceptional doctoral
students recognized at this level.”
