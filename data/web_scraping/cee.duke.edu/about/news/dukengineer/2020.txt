## Faculty Innovation

### Illuminating the Dark Genome

Duke’s Center for Advanced Genomic Technologies shines brightly on the horizon

### Machine Learning Protecting Human Privacy

Duke Engineers are pioneering techniques to scan a person’s face while
ignoring certain sensitive features that someone might not want their device
to access

### Versatility of Machine Learning

David Carlson is helping colleagues across campus use machine learning in
their own fields of expertise while removing the “black box” from the equation

## The Undergraduate Experience

### Engineering 101: A Low-Cost Solution to Gastroschisis

Two teams of first-year engineers combine forces to find a solution for
infants suffering from gastroschisis in low-resource settings

### Infinite Opportunities: Pratt Research Fellows

The Pratt Research Fellows program offers juniors the opportunity to pursue
valuable research experience for three semesters and a summer

### Technology and Sustainability: Student Projects at the Smart Home

Each year, Duke Smart Home residents and club members develop and test a wide
array of new projects and initiatives focused on sustainable living

### First-Year Students Learn to Thrive

The new zero-credit course 'Thrive' arms first-year students with tools to
