Duke team wins prize for most human-like sonnet written by A.I.

_From Duke Today  
_

Shall I compare thee to a robo-poet? Last spring, a team of Duke students
embarked on a class project to see if they could teach a computer to write
Shakespearean sonnets that could pass for ones written by humans.

One semester later, the algorithm they developed has won the 2018 “PoetiX”
competition for computer-generated poetry.

Team member Peter Hase ’19 admits he’s no poet. “I could not write a sonnet.
I’m not artistic,” Hase said.

But the exercise forced him and fellow student programmers and data geeks to
think about what goes into writing poetry, while picking up machine learning
skills along the way.

Poetry presents unique challenges for computers, said the team’s coach Cynthia
Rudin, associate professor of computer science, electrical and computer
engineering, and statistics at Duke.

As humans, we intuitively understand the often unwritten rules of grammar and
syntax, not to mention metaphors, idioms and turns of phrase. But “there are a
lot of nuances in the English language that computers don’t know,” Rudin said.

A human would recognize that the word “blue” can refer to a mood or a color,
for example—one of many double meanings that machines fail to grasp.

Not to mention that you can’t tell a computer to tap into its feelings.

The system learned how to compose sentences by studying other writers. To
train their model, the team fed their bot the collected works of Walt Whitman,
as well as “The Hunger Games” trilogy, and a poem in iambic pentameter by John
Keats. It was then up to the computer to write its own sonnets.

Given a one-word prompt—such as “love,” “sad” or “nature”—it automatically
spits out 14 lines of rhyming verse, with the da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM rhythm of
iambic pentameter.

The algorithm composes each line in reverse, starting with the end rhyming
words and working backward one word at a time until it has 10 syllables per
line.

It can quickly identify all the words in its 14,000-word vocabulary that give
it the right meter and crank out its creations in roughly 10 minutes.

“You can produce a lot of poems in a short period of time,” said team member
John Benhart ’19.

Joined by Duke students Tianlin Duan ’18 and Liuyi Zhu ’19, the team hasn’t
created a computerized Shakespeare successor or Walt Whitman hopeful yet.

Some of the more cringe-worthy results made their friends and classmates
laugh. Commas sometimes appear in the wrong place, or grammatical errors give
them away.

“If we went through and picked the worst quatrains you’d say ‘this doesn’t
make any sense,’” Hase said. “It’s kind of high-variance.”

But their algorithm serves up more than word salad with the correct rhythm and
rhyme scheme. “Sometimes these poems are coincidentally really good,” Rudin
said. “Every once in a while it generates something that just happened to make
beautiful sense.”

For the PoetiX competition, computer-generated sonnets were mixed with sonnets
written by flesh-and-blood humans, then a panel of judges had to guess whether
they were written by a person or a machine.

While none of the machine-written entries in this year’s competition managed
to dupe the judges, a computer-generated sonnet from the Duke team’s algorithm
was deemed the most convincing.

Computer-generated poetry is not new. In the 1830s and 1840s, an eccentric
English inventor named John Clark spent over a decade building Eureka, a
nightstand-sized machine that generated gloomy Latin verse, one line per
minute, for the price of a shilling.

And in 2011, a Duke undergraduate named Zachary Scholl developed a poetry bot
that got published in Duke's literary magazine The Archive, without revealing
to the editors that the poems were written by a machine.

“After working on this it feels like computers are pretty far away from being
able to write a play or a novel,” said Benhart, who also enjoys writing the
old fashioned way.

“Now we’re trying to add more meaning and coherence in between lines,” Benhart
said. “There’s still so much room to improve.”

_The Duke Data Science Team got its start as a computer science class first
offered in spring 2018, taught by Cynthia Rudin, with teaching assistant
Rachel Ballantyne-Draelos. Within its first six months the team has entered
and won two competitions._
