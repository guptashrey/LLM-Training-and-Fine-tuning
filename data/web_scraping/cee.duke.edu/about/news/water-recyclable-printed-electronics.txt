# Fully Recyclable Printed Electronics Ditch Toxic Chemicals for Water

April 6, 2023 | By Ken Kingery

First-of-its-kind demonstration suggests a more environmentally friendly
future for the electronics industry is possible

Engineers at Duke University have produced the world’s first fully recyclable
printed electronics that replace the use of chemicals with water in the
fabrication process. By bypassing the need for hazardous chemicals, the
demonstration points down a path industry could follow to reduce its
environmental footprint and human health risks.

The research appeared online Feb. 28 in the journal Nano Letters.

One of the dominant challenges facing any electronics manufacturer is
successfully securing several layers of components on top of each other, which
is crucial to making complex devices. Getting these layers to stick together
can be a frustrating process, particularly for printed electronics.

“If you’re making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, one layer on either
slice of bread is easy,” explained Aaron Franklin, the Addy Professor of
Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke, who led the study. “But if you
put the jelly down first and then try to spread peanut butter on top of it,
forget it, the jelly won’t stay put and will intermix with the peanut butter.
Putting layers on top of each other is not as easy as putting them down on
their own — but that’s what you have to do if you want to build electronic
devices with printing.”

In previous work, Franklin and his group demonstrated the first fully
recyclable printed electronics. The devices used three carbon-based inks:
semiconducting carbon nanotubes, conductive graphene and insulating
nanocellulose. In trying to adapt the original process to only use water, the
carbon nanotubes presented the largest challenge.

To make a water-based ink in which the carbon nanotubes don’t clump together
and spread evenly on a surface, a surfactant similar to detergent is added.
The resulting ink, however, does not create a layer of carbon nanotubes dense
enough for a high current of electrons to travel across.

“You want the carbon nanotubes to look like al dente spaghetti strewn down on
a flat surface,” said Franklin. “But with a water-based ink, they look more
like they’ve been taken one-by-one and tossed on a wall to check for doneness.
If we were using chemicals, we could just print multiple passes again and
again until there were enough nanotubes. But water doesn’t work that way. We
could do it 100 times and there’d still be the same density as the first
time.”

This is because the surfactant used to keep the carbon nanotubes from clumping
also prevents additional layers from adhering to the first. In a traditional
manufacturing process, these surfactants would be removed using either very
high temperatures, which takes a lot of energy, or harsh chemicals, which can
pose human and environmental health risks. Franklin and his group wanted to
avoid both.

In the paper, Franklin and his group develop a cyclical process in which the
device is rinsed with water, dried in relatively low heat and printed on
again. When the amount of surfactant used in the ink is also tuned down, the
researchers show that their inks and processes can create fully functional,
fully recyclable, fully water-based transistors.

Compared to a resistor or capacitor, a transistor is a relatively complex
computer component used in devices such as power control or logic circuits and
sensors. Franklin explains that, by demonstrating a transistor first, he hopes
to signal to the rest of the field that there is a viable path toward making
some electronics manufacturing processes much more environmentally friendly.

Franklin has already proven that nearly 100% of the carbon nanotubes and
graphene used in printing can be recovered and reused in the same process,
losing very little of the substances or their performance viability. Because
nanocellulose is made from wood, it can simply be recycled or biodegraded like
paper. And while the process does use a lot of water, it’s not nearly as much
as what is required to deal with the toxic chemicals used in traditional
fabrication methods.

According to a United Nations estimate, less than a quarter of the millions of
pounds of electronics thrown away each year is recycled. And the problem is
only going to get worse as the world eventually upgrades to 6G devices and the
Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand. So any dent that could be made
in this growing mountain of electronic trash is important to pursue.

While more work needs to be done, Franklin says the approach could be used in
the manufacturing of other electronic components like the screens and displays
that are now ubiquitous to society. Every electronic display has a backplane
of thin-film transistors similar to what is demonstrated in the paper. The
current fabrication technology is high-energy and relies on hazardous
chemicals as well as toxic gasses. The entire industry has been flagged for
immediate attention by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

“The performance of our thin-film transistors doesn’t match the best currently
being manufactured, but they’re competitive enough to show the research
community that we should all be doing more work to make these processes more
environmentally friendly,” Franklin said.

This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R01HL146849),
the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-22-1-0466), and the
National Science Foundation (ECCS-1542015, Graduate Research Fellowship
