# Neil Gong: At the Intersection of Security, Privacy and Machine Learning

July 30, 2019

New faculty member Neil Gong is exploring privacy and security issues and
techniques related to machine learning and artificial intelligence

Neil Gong joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the
Duke University Pratt School of Engineering on July 1, 2019. An expert in
digital security technologies, Gong is one of a handful of researchers at the
forefront of exploring privacy and security issues and techniques related to
machine learning and artificial intelligence.

“Machine learning is being deployed in many aspects of our societies like
self-driving cars, precision healthcare and cybersecurity,” said Gong, who
joins Duke’s faculty from Iowa State University. “And hackers are always
motivated to follow emerging technologies to find new vulnerabilities as well
as new tools for their trade.”

Gong earned a B.E. in computer science from the University of Science and
Technology of China in 2010 before completing his PhD in the same field at the
University of California – Berkeley in 2015. It was there Gong got hooked on
the subject.

> "Now that machine learning applications are being widely used, the
> intersection between privacy and security is an emerging area of research.
> Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU and Google all have groups focused on these
> questions. I decided to come to Duke and stay in academia because of the
> flexibility it provides in answering more fundamental research questions
> that might take years to pay off commercially."

Gong’s research focuses on two aspects of the intersection of privacy,
security and machine learning. The first is trying to figure out how malicious
actors might misuse machine learning techniques to attack computer and network
systems as well as how to leverage machine learning to enhance cybersecurity
and privacy. The second is to study the vulnerabilities of machine learning
itself and how to build secure and privacy-preserving machine learning.

For example, when large tech companies such as Facebook or Google implement
machine learning algorithms, they are typically embedded within the programs
or applications themselves. This leaves them vulnerable to hackers to design
their own machine learning algorithms that can eventually reverse engineer the
intellectual property being used.

Another example in the area of privacy is how some companies such as Cambridge
Analytica are working to mine data from user profiles across social media
platforms. While some of this activity is legal, other efforts use machine
learning to try to use what data is available to infer private information
purposefully left out of public profiles.

“But it might be possible to defend against attacks like these by including a
few pieces of false information in a profile,” explained Gong. “The question
is how many pieces are needed and what types of information work best.”

Another aspect of Gong’s research deals with finding ways of keeping medical
data secure even when it’s being used by large machine learning research
projects designed to improve patient health. This line of study could find
wide use for Duke’s emerging leadership in this field through programs such as
Duke Forge.

“Now that machine learning applications are being widely used, the
intersection between privacy and security is an emerging area of research,”
said Gong. “Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, CMU and Google all have groups focused on
these questions. I decided to come to Duke and stay in academia because of the
flexibility it provides in answering more fundamental research questions that
might take years to pay off commercially.”
