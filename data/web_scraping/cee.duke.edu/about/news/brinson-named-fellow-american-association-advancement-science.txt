Six members of the Duke University faculty have been named Fellows of the

recognized for scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance
science or its applications. The inductee from Duke Engineering is Cate
Brinson, Ph.D., Sharon C. and Harold Yoh, III Distinguished Professor and
Donald M. Alstadt Chair of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science.
Brinson was recognized for distinguished contributions to the field of
mechanics of materials, particularly for hierarchical characterization and
modeling of nanostructured polymers and shape memory alloys.

View the orginial announcement on Duke Today to see the full list of inductees
from Duke University.

The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. A virtual induction ceremony for
the new fellows in the organization's 24 sections will be held on February 13,
