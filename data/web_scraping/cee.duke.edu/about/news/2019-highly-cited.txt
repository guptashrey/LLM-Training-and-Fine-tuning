# Six Duke Engineers Among Global Highly Cited

November 20, 2019

Annual Clarivate Analytics list includes 54 Duke researchers, tying the
university for 8th worldwide

_Adapted from Duke Today_

The list of Highly Cited Researchers for 2019 includes six Duke engineering
professors spanning all four Pratt School of Engineering departments: Charles
Gersbach (BME), David Mitzi (MEMS), Willie Padilla (ECE), Guillermo Sapiro
(ECE), David Smith (ECE) and Mark Wiesner (CEE). The researchers are
internationally recognized for their work in fields including genomics,
metamaterials and engineering physics, materials science, environmental
impacts and machine learning.

Overall, the list includes 54 of Duke University's most prominent and
influential researchers. That number puts Duke into a four-way tie for 8th
among the world’s universities for its number of highly-cited scientists.

Citation rate—the number of times a given author’s work appears in the
citations of other papers—is a proxy for the influence and importance of a
scientist’s work. This annual metric has been compiled for decades by a
company now called ISI-Web of Science, a Clarivate Analytics company.

The listing is intended to recognize “researchers with broad community
influence,” the organization says.

The data are taken from 21 broad research fields. The fields are defined by
sets of journals and, in the case of multidisciplinary journals such as
_Nature_ and _Science_ , by a paper-by-paper assignment to a field based on an
analysis of the cited references in the papers. ISI-Web of Science also
weighted the occurrence of self-citation in their analyses, though this
practice varies by discipline.
