# Bejan Named Member of the Academia Europaea

October 28, 2013

Bejan is noted for research in wide range of topics in thermodynamics

Adrian Bejan, the J.A. Jones Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Duke, has
been named a member of Academia Europaea, the Academy of Europe.

The Academia Europaea comprises 3,000 eminent scholars of international
distinction, irrespective of nationality, location or discipline. Members are
nominated by their peers and confirmed by the Council of the Academia.

Bejan, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is noted for
research in wide range of topics in thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid
mechanics, convection and porous media, and for developing the constructal law
of design in nature (constructal.org).

He is the author of 28 books and 580 peer-referred articles, and has ranked
since 2001 among the 100 most highly cited authors worldwide in engineering
according to the Institute for Scientific Information. Bejan has received 16
honorary doctorates from universities in 11 countries.

Bejan and other new members of the Academia Europaea will be inducted during
the academy’s 2014 annual conference in Barcelona, Spain.
