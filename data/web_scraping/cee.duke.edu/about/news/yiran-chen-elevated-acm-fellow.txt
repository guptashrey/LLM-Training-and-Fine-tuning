# Yiran Chen Elevated to ACM Fellow

January 13, 2021

Chen was cited for his contributions to nonvolatile memory technologies

Duke professor of electrical and computer engineering Yiran Chen has been
named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world's
largest educational and scientific computing society.

Fellowship is the organization’s highest level of membership and recognizes
the top one percent of ACM’s members for outstanding accomplishments in
computing and information technology and/or outstanding service to ACM and the
larger computing community. Chen, who was cited for his contributions to
nonvolatile memory technologies, was named a Distinguished Member by the ACM
just two years ago.

The ACM Fellowship is the latest of a string of prestigious awards captured by
Chen. In 2020 alone, Chen was inducted into the High-Performance Computer
Architecture (HPCA) Hall of Fame, received an ASP-DAC Prolific Author Award
and won a prestigious IEEE Mid-Career Award. His coauthored work also received
the Best Student Paper Award from the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2020.

Chen directs the National Science Foundation-funded Alternative Sustainable &
Intelligent Computing (ASIC) consortium, a center focused on emerging
computing platforms for cognitive applications. He co-directs the Duke Center
for Computational Evolutionary Intelligence, which develops innovative memory
and storage systems and new applications for machine learning, neuromorphic
computing and mobile computing systems. He currently serves as Editor-in-Chief
of _IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine._
