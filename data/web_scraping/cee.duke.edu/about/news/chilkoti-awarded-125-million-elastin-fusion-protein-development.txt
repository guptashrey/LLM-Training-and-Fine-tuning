# Chilkoti Awarded $1.25 Million for Elastin Fusion Protein Development

September 30, 2014

A renewed grant from the National Institutes of Health will yield new peptide
polymers with diverse applications.

Tosh Chilkoti, professor and chair of the biomedical engineering department at
Duke, has been awarded a new, four-year, $1.25 million grant from the National
Institutes of Health. The award marks the fourth such grant Chilkoti has
received for his work on elastin fusion proteins, which is now entering its
13th consecutive year of funding.

For more than a decade, Chilkoti and his team have investigated how to fuse
strings of biomolecular building blocks called peptide sequences to proteins.
This allows researchers to finely tune characteristics such as solubility in
water, which can be used to develop novel methods to purify protein samples or
deliver drugs by converting them into polymers.

Polymers can be used to deliver drugs that do not dissolve well in water by
hiding them inside polymer nanoparticles, sort of like a nano-pill. Polymers
can also be fused to protein or peptide drugs so that they are retained by the
body for longer periods of time, improving their effectiveness.

With the renewed grant, Chilkoti will begin investigating a new class of
peptide sequences.

“We’re proposing a radical departure from the kinds of sequences we used to
work with,” said Chilkoti. “We’ve found a full new range of sequences that
look and behave similarly to those that we’ve been investigating, but with
important differences. As we learn more about them, we anticipate that we’ll
be able to greatly expand the palette of applications that come about when you
take these amino-acid-based polymers and genetically fuse them to proteins.”

outrageously ambitious
