# Master of Engineering in Photonics and Optical Sciences

Our students train with leaders in the field

**Duke’s Master of Engineering (MEng) in Photonics and Optical Sciences** is
an alternative to a traditional master of science program that will deepen
your understanding of technology and help you develop the business leadership
and management expertise you need to succeed in your career. In the Master of
Engineering program, you take specialized technical classes and a core of
business leadership and management courses, with a required internship or a
project completing the degree.

Duke is home to the Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics (FIP), where
researchers are making strides across many areas of photonics and optical
science—including making scalable quantum computing a reality, helping doctors
do a better job of eradicating cancer, and developing the next generation of
high-throughput imaging systems. The research of the FIP faculty is reflected
in the courses offered through our Master of Engineering in Photonics and
Optical Sciences.

Master of Engineering students train with the very best people in the optics
field, and pair that classroom experience with an understanding of core
business principles. Our graduates have the technical savvy to move
discoveries forward and the business skills to shepherd important advances to
realization.

The exceptional resources available through the Fitzpatrick Institute, the
Corporate Partnership Program, and the Carolinas Photonics Consortium make
Duke a great choice for graduate studies in photonics and optical sciences.

## Resources

### Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics

The Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics is an interdisciplinary effort at Duke
to advance photonics and optical sciences. The institute leverages Duke’s
faculty from the Pratt School of Engineering, Trinity College of Arts and
Sciences, and the Duke School of Medicine to explore problems at the boundary
nexus of nano-bio-info-opto convergence. Learn more »

### Carolinas Photonics Consortium

The Carolinas Photonics Consortium, located in Duke's region within the United
States, is the largest concentration of photonics-based resources in the
country.

The commercial opportunities for bringing technology into the service of
society provides a natural resource for Master of Engineering students as they
learn to manage technology knowledge with business realities so that they may
open paths yet untapped for the Photonics and Optical Sciences fields.

### Corporate Partnership Program

The Corporate Partnership Program actively encourages the collaboration of
faculty with corporate partners and promotes technology transfer for regional
economic development.

The impact on students reaches beyond the faculty relationships to networking
opportunities, as well as potential project sources for the Master of
Engineering internship requirement.
