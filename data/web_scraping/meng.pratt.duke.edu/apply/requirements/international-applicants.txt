# International Applicants

Unlike many schools, Duke does not require financial support documents as part
of the application; instead, students submit this information after they have
been admitted and are enrolled in the program.

Duke does not automatically issue I-20s to students upon admission. Instead,
students work with the department to submit information and supporting
documents to Duke's Visa Services Office. The process is described below.

  * Upon accepting the offer of admission, a student will receive an email
    from our office with a User Name and password in order to complete the
    online Request for Temporary Visa Form - Part II.
  * The student completes the online form, prints it off, signs it, and
    returns it to our office, along with the appropriate supporting documents.
  * Students must show liquid funds in the total amount listed in the PDF
    document available on our Tuition page.
  * **Financial documents must be less than four months old.**
  * Only after we receive everything from the student will our office complete
    Part I of the Request for Temporary Visa Form. At that time, the student’s
    entire packet will be sent to Duke Visa Services for processing.
  * Visa documents (I-20 or DS-2019) are usually issued within 2 calendar
    weeks from the date that Duke Visa Services received the completed packet.
  * Register for your visa appointment only after you receive your visa
    documents.

Those on non-Duke visas complete a modified process during the enrollment
period.

## Duke University Policy on Documentation of Non-Citizen Students

  1. All non-citizen students (undergraduate, graduate and professional) must present evidence of immigration status to the Duke Visa Services Office before the first day of classes and whenever, thereafter, their status changes. Failure to comply will result in the inability to enroll for classes. Students who are outside the U.S. and who are therefore unable to comply (e.g. visa stamp delays) will be handled on a case by case basis.
  2. Undergraduate students who are not in lawful status, but who accurately report their status, will be allowed to enroll. Such students will be advised of the risks to them of being out of status and the importance of dealing with that situation through their own means and with private immigration counsel. Students who are not in lawful status are not eligible for Federal financial aid, but they may apply for Duke-based assistance.
  3. Individual cases deemed worthy of a temporary exception to this Policy due to unusual circumstances may be presented to a hearing committee, by Duke Visa Services or the appropriate departmental representative, for consideration and recommendation to the Provost. The committee shall be composed of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, the Director of Visa Services and the appropriate representative from the student's school or program.
