# Grade Scale

Upload to us the official scale your institution uses

Your Grade Scale (also known as: grading system, score system, or percentage
system) tells us what your grades mean.

It does not need to convert to a 4.0 scale, but should show differentiation
between passing scores, and indicate what is a failing score at your
institution. It should also explain other marks on your transcript, such as
Withdrawal, Audit, or Incomplete.

Please upload to us the official scale your institution uses. This can be the
reverse side of your transcript, a screen shot of the registrar’s guidelines
or an excerpt from your transcript.

Please see the examples below.
