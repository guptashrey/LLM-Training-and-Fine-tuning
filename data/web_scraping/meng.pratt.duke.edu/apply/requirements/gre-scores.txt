# GRE Scores

GRE scores (degree applicants)

> ### Announcement
>
> The GRE is now optional for the 2023 application cycle only.

In light of testing center disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
MEng Program has waived the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test score
requirement for the 2023 application cycle. Applicants may still submit GRE
scores if they feel the scores enhance their application, and we will accept
results from ETS' GRE at home. If you choose to enter self-reported test
scores, official test scores will become a required component of your
application. The scores must not be more than five years old, and an official
copy must be sent to Duke directly from the Educational Testing Service (ETS).

( _Note: GRE scores are_ **not** _required to apply to our Graduate
Certificate Programs_.)

When sending scores to Duke, please indicate:

  * Institution code **5156**
  * Department code **5199** ("Any department not listed")

Personal copies are not acceptable, nor are "attested" or notarized copies.

ETS can take several weeks to send electronic scores to schools, so you should
plan to take the test or order prior scores at least one month prior to the
deadline you seek.

**You must send official score reports to Duke, and scores must arrive prior
tothe application deadline.**

We do not require a minimum score.

For further information on the GRE, please visit gre.org »

## Name Discrepancies

We receive GRE scores electronically from the ETS. Because we match scores by
applicant's name, it is important your name on the application and your name
on your test scores be the same.

If not, you must contact us.

## Dual degree candidates

Generally, the Duke Master's of Engineering Program requires GRE scores for
all applicants. An exception is made for dual degree candidates in programs at
Duke University. If this applies to you, contact us for more information.
