# Uploading a Transcript

Upload one copy of your unofficial transcript from each institution you have
attended

After submitting your application and paying the application fee, you are
required to upload one copy of your scanned unofficial transcript from each
institution you have attended.

* * *

### Important Notes

  * The transcript upload option will not appear until you have submitted the
    questions and paid the fee
  * Non-legible scans will not be accepted—Make sure your scanned documents
    are readable before uploading, as non-legible documents will result in
    delays
  * To be considered, all documents not in English must be accompanied by
    official English translations—These translations must bear an original ink
    signature and seal, and translations alone will not be acceptable
  * Do not mail your official transcripts to us

* * *

The process of uploading transcripts is intended to eliminate the need for you
to mail in your transcripts, as our department will be able to review your
application based on your uploaded transcripts.

If you are recommended for admission by our department, you will be required
to provide official copies of your transcripts at that time. These copies
should be sent to our office by mail or via electronic transfer directly from
your institution.

If you are offered admission and have not yet graduated, you will also be
required to provide another copy of your transcript upon the awarding of your
degree and its posting to your transcript.

**Duke University reserves the right to rescind any offer of admission if any
discrepancies are found between your uploaded and official transcript[s].**

## Options for uploading a transcript

  * Some universities offer electronic transcripts. Check with your
    institution's registrar.
  * You may scan a copy of a paper transcript.
  * You may upload your institution's web-based academic record, if available.

### Important Guidelines

  * Make sure your file text is **vertically** oriented.
  * Make sure that **all** critical and identifying marks have been scanned
    and are legible. These include the institution's name, your name, the
    names of your courses and the grades you have received.
  * Make sure that your file is in Word (.doc) or PDF format and does not
    exceed 1.5 MB (1,500 kb) in size.
  * To reach the minimum size, you may have to scan your file at the lowest
    DPI that produces a legible image. In most cases, you will be able to use
    a DPI under 200.
  * You may scan in color, though for a smaller file size, we suggest using
    grayscale. Otherwise use black and white.

Once you have uploaded your file, **click the "View Document" button to ensure
that the document you've uploaded is legible throughout**. If it is not
legible, try again. You may need to adjust the settings of your scanner to
produce a scan that is both legible and smaller than 1.5 MB.

Finally, if you are unable to upload a legible transcript, you will be asked
to have an official transcript mailed to our office. Contact us for help; as
this is separate from our standard process, it will result in a delay in the
review of your application.

Applicants from China and India may find these Transcript Guidelines helpful.
