# Video Introduction and Video Interview

## Video Introduction

Your Duke Engineering application includes a required video introduction in
which you'll answer one question. The question prompt will be shown to you,
and you will have at least 60 seconds of preparation time.

_**Note:** If you have mutliple applications in our system, you may see
mutiple questions. For the MEng application, use the question labeled Pratt.
For an MS or PhD application, use the question labeled Engineering._

You do not have to use the entire time if you do not need that much.

You may start over once, but the question will change.

Please relax and know this is a nerve-wracking experience for everyone! It is
only one part of your overall application and we are simply using it to get to
know you better.

## Interview

We may invite some candidates to interview before an admission decision can be
posted. Please note:

  * **Interviews are offered by invitation only** and are based on a thorough
    evaluation of your complete application.
  * **You may not request an interview.** Instead, selected applicants will be
    invited to interview and given instructions on moving forward in the
    interview process.
  * Interviews are conducted by staff members and are generally completed in
    the weeks prior to our decision notification date. See below for Interview
    Tips.
  * An interview does not guarantee admission.

While interviews allow us to learn more about you, they also give you the
opportunity to learn more about Duke and see if this program is right for you.
There will be time for your questions during the interview – use it!

### Interview Tips

  1. Duke uses Slate Scheduler and Zoom to conduct **video** interviews.
  2. We suggest that you log in to the interview **via computer.** Mobile devices (e.g. phones) may not work as well.
  3. Video requires **reliable internet access**. Free and private wireless signals should not be used. An Ethernet cable can provide a clear connection. 
  4. We encourage you to use a **headset with a microphone** built in during the video interview. A headset will prevent background noise from overpowering your voice. You may find it helpful to mute yourself when you're not talking. 
  5. Check sound settings so that you’re ready when the interview starts. If you are using headphones with a microphone, make sure those components are selected over your computer’s default audio.
  6. Don’t let your computer die mid-question. Charge your machine fully or plug it in during the interview.
  7. The access link for your interview can be found in your email.

### Joining the Interview

You'll receive a link in your interview confirmation email. That link will
connect you to the Zoom meeting. You may be placed in a waiting room, but you
will be admitted to the session when the interview starts.

When you join the meeting successfully, be sure to Join With Computer Audio so
that you can hear the interviewer and the interviewer can hear you.
