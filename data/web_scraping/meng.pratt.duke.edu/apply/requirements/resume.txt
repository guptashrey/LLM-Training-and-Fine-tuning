# Resume

We require a resume highlighting experience, activities, and leadership,
whether in the classroom, in a volunteer setting, a club or organization, or
on the job. Work experience is not required for the campus program, but
current undergraduates can focus on any internship experience they have.

If you have a preferred format, please use it. If you don't, you might find it
helpful to view a couple of sample resumes below from current Duke students.
Notice the kind of information they highlight. Generally, students with little
experience should be able to get their resume down to a maximum of two pages.

Master of Engineering (MEng) Discipline Resume Example  
Biomedical Engineering Example 1  
Electrical and Computer Engineering Example 2  
Environmental Engineering Example 3
