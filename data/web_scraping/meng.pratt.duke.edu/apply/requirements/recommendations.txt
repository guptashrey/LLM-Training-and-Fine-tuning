# Recommendations

Recommendations are submitted electronically via the online application

We require:

  * Master of Engineering (MEng) applicants to provide **three (3) letters of
    recommendation**
  * Graduate Certificate and non-degree applicants to provide **two (2)
    letters of recommendation**

The letters can be academic or professional. If you’re still a student, at
least one should be academic. If you’re a working professional, it’s fine for
all to be professional.

When choosing academic recommendation providers, do not simply choose those
professors who gave you the highest grades. Instead, think about selecting
those who can give insight into your preparedness for the Master of
Engineering (MEng) program. Give them an overview of the program, along with a
copy of your resume and an understanding of your goals.

**Recommendations must be submitted electronically via the online
application.** You will be required to enter the contact information of your
recommenders (including email address), and the recommenders will, in turn, be
sent a link from which they access the online recommendation form and be given
the opportunity to upload a letter in support of your application.
