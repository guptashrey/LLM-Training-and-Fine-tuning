## Financial Aid

Apply for aid »

### Academic Scholarships

Financial aid is available to highly qualified candidates for the Master of
Engineering (MEng) through academic scholarships with an emphasis on
increasing diversity within our master's degree programs.

Selected students, who by reason of their background, culture, socioeconomic
status, race, ethnicity, work, and life experiences contribute to a fuller
representation of perspectives within the academic life of the university, may
receive up to 50 percent per year in tuition scholarship through our Diversity
Scholarships. Additionally, up to $10,000 per year may be allocated for the
student to gain experience in a research setting under the direction of a
principal investigator (PI).

### Competitively Awarded Fellowships

The Pratt School of Engineering encourages our graduate students to apply for
competitively awarded research fellowships.

In addition to extra training, resources and career-building opportunities, a
fellowship identifies as a student as top scholar, and bestows a measure of
honor and recognition.

### Loans

Duke University Graduate School financial aid packages for domestic master
students are limited to the federal financial aid offered by Direct Lending
Federal Loan Programs.

In order to be considered for federal financial aid which includes federal
work study funding; you must complete the FAFSA application. The FAFSA (Free
Application for Federal Student Aid) is required for any need based loan
program along with federal work study. Below is one of the basic eligibility
requirements to receive federal student aid:

  * Be a United States Citizen or an eligible noncitizen
  * If you have a “green card” (in other words, if you are a permanent
    resident alien), you will be considered an “eligible noncitizen” and will
    be able to get federal student aid if you meet the other basic eligibility
    criteria.

If you meet the eligibility requirements, please continue to fafsa.ed.gov. You
will need to file the 2022/2023 FAFSA and have your completed tax returns for
2019. Graduate Students are considered independent therefore, NO parental
income or information should be entered on the FAFSA. Our school code is
002920.

Visit the Duke Financial Aid website for more information on application
procedures for student loans.

Duke University maintains information on lenders for citizens, permanent
residents, and non-US citizens - see this information here.

Students awarded Federal loans must make satisfactory academic progress toward
their degree. Guidelines may be found here.

### On-Campus Work

Campus Programs Only

While enrolled in the campus program, many students work in a variety of
places, such as campus libraries and various departments within Duke
University. Teaching assistantships are available in various departments, and
some departments have research assistantships as well.

These positions are paid an hourly rate, and most students work between 10 to
20 hours per week. Positions are generally posted and filled just a week or
two before classes begin each semester.

### Veterans Education Benefits

Duke University offers information for veterans who are applying for U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, including the Yellow Ribbon
Program. Veterans who are applying for VA benefits to participate in one of
Duke’s Master of Engineering programs should list “Master of Engineering” as
the title of their program on the application, rather than the specific
department/program MEng in which they are participating.
