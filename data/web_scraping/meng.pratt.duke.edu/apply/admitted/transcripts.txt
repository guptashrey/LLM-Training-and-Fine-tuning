# Submitting Final Transcripts

For Admitted Students

Welcome to Duke Engineering's professional programs!

Now that you've been admitted and accepted our offer, you should submit final
official transcripts from each institution listed in your application.

## For all who accept Duke's offer of admission

Now that you've been admitted and have accepted Duke's offer, you should now
submit final official transcripts from each institution listed in your
application.

  * If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at
    pratt_masters@duke.edu
  * If your transcripts cannot be sent due to a valid extenuating
    circumstance, contact pratt_masters@duke.edu
  * NOTE: There is no need to provide separate transcripts from study-abroad
    institutions, as long as the study-abroad credits appear on your official
    transcript from your home educational institution

## How to Submit Your Transcript

Please request that each institution you have attended send Duke a final
official transcript. Electronic transcripts are preferred.

Each transcript should show:

  * All work completed
  * Name of the degree conferred
  * The date the degree was conferred
  * A signature, in ink, of the appropriate official (examples: Registrar,
    Recorder of Records)
  * Official institutional seal

### Electronic Transcripts

  * Are preferred by Duke
  * Electronic transcripts sent directly from the educational institution to
    Duke are considered official
  * Have electronic transcripts sent to pratt_masters@duke.edu
  * If your educational institution uses Parchment services, our name is:
    * "Duke University-Master Of Engineering Management (MEM) And Master Of Engineering (MEng)"

### Paper Transcripts

Electronic transcripts are preferred.

## Transcript Concerns

  * **Your Degree Has Been Conferred  
** If you have already completed a degree, please request that the school send
Duke a final transcript showing all work completed, date of degree, and date
degree conferred. _However_ , if your transcript does not include the date and
degree conferred, you must also submit a copy of your diploma, graduation
certificate, or degree verification document.

  * **Your Final Transcript is Not Yet Available  
** If you completed your degree very recently or are still enrolled in a
degree program, your final official transcript may not be available until very
close to your enrollment date (late December/ early January or late summer).
Duke will matriculate you without the final transcript. _However_ , you must
submit your final official transcript during new-student orientation, or your
student status may be in jeopardy. Once the final transcript becomes
available, request that it be sent to Duke immediately.

  * **You Only Have One Final Official Transcript  
** We are aware that some international schools issue only one official
transcript. If this is the case for the school or schools you attended, DO NOT
send these documents to us. Unfortunately, Duke cannot return materials
submitted in support of an application. _Instead_ , send us exact copies that
have been stamped as "Certified True Copies" by the appropriate institutional
official of each institution that you attended. Copies that are not certified
are not acceptable.

  * **Your Transcript is in a Language Other Than English  
** If your final official transcripts are not in English, please provide BOTH
the original official transcript AND an English translation. If your
institution does not issue documents in English, you must have the transcripts
translated by a professional translation service. Self‐translations and
notarized translations will not be accepted.

  * **You Do Not Submit Your Official Transcripts  
** The submission of the final official transcript is essential for enrollment
at Duke. If you do not verify your degree and submit your transcript before
orientation, your enrollment could be in jeopardy. Therefore, you must send
the required transcripts to Duke as soon as possible.
