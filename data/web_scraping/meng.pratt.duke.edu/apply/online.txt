## Important Notes

you've paid your fee, your application will be forwarded to the admissions
committee for review.

If any required component is missing, your file will not be considered. You'll
be able to monitor the status of your application within the application
system.

_**Think of submitting your online application as sealing and mailing an
envelope—Once it has been submitted, none of the documents enclosed within it
can be altered. Please proofread carefully before submitting it.**_
