# Internship/Project

As a Master of Engineering student, you have the choice of a non-credit
internship or a project as part of the curriculum, and you’ll take part in a
follow-up assessment. This is applied learning at its best, and the self-
analysis afterwards will help you better define what you want and need for
career development. Individual departments may have additional requirements or
exceptions for fulfilling these degree components.

## MENG 550: Master of Engineering Internship/Project

Internships are typically 8-12 weeks. The minimum hourly requirement for the
internship is 320 hours, equivalent to 8 weeks, 40 hours per week.

Projects require approval from your faculty adviser. Projects must fulfill the
same learning objectives as internships. Individual programs/majors may have
additional requirements or exceptions to fulfill the internship component of
the program.

All internships/projects must:

  * Apply engineering principles to solving one or more problems outside the
    classroom environment
  * Define a problem and determine potential solutions
  * Appreciate the importance of organizational dynamics and work
    relationships
  * Practice professional communication both written and orally
  * Complement material presented in MEng courses
  * Include a self assessment upon completion in MENG 551(251)

## MENG 551(251): Master of Engineering Internship/Project Assessment

The MEng Assessment course is the culmination of your internship or project
work. You will prepare a substantive assessment of your internship or project
experience via a written report and/or oral presentation. A polished analysis
should include:

  * Problem or task conducted
  * Challenges faced
  * Solutions incorporated
  * Workplace communication and interpersonal relationship critique
  * Individual performance review
