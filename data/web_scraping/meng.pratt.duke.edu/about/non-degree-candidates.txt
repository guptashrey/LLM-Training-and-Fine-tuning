# Non-Degree Candidates

## Non-Degree Option

Students who do not intend to obtain an MEng Degree but are interested in some
MEng coursework may take courses as a non-degree student. Non-degree status is
distinct from MEng degree student status; therefore, if a student decides to
become a part time or full time MEng Degree student, a separate application
and application fee are required, and applicants must adhere to our standard
admissions deadlines. A maximum of four courses taken as a non-degree student
may be applied to the degree program if the student is admitted. Only classes
where the student earned a “B” or better are eligible to be transferred to the
degree program. Note that tuition for these courses is paid separately from
any other programs a student is currently taking.

## Course Options

Non-degree students may take any graduate course within the Pratt School of
Engineering.

## Admission Deadlines

Non-degree applications should be submitted by March 15.

## Non-degree Application Requirements

Non-degree applicants are required to submit all standard application
requirements with the exception of the GRE:

  * a bachelor's degree in engineering or science from an accredited
    institution (transcripts required)*
  * Resume*
  * Short Answer Essays*
  * Two recommendations*
  * A short video introduction
  * An application fee of $75 US, to be paid via credit card*

_*items that can be submitted online using theonline application_

Again, note that non-degree students are not required to submit GRE scores.
