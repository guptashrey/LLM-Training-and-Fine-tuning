# PhD—Doctoral Study

Rigorous advanced training in Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science
with personalized mentorship from faculty research leaders

## The Duke Difference

  * **World-class research **with global impact in energy, automation, and
    health care
  * **Uniquely interdisciplinary environment** —MEMS faculty and students work
    closely with collaborators within Duke's Trinity College of Arts &
    Sciences, School of Medicine, and Nicholas School of the Environment, as
    well as with national and international collaborators at universities, in
    industry, and at national labs
  * **Financial support** —Duke MEMS is committed to providing tuition,
    stipend, and health insurance for all PhD students. Also, MEMS provides
    travel and registration funds to support your participation in national
    and international conferences
  * **Internships** —MEMS PhD students are encouraged to work with their

## A Personal Mentoring Team

A broad mentoring network is a hallmark of the Duke MEMS PhD experience. We
believe in creating a highly interdisciplinary research community.

PhD students work closely with a research advisor. In addition, we help you
form a personal Mentoring Team that includes a faculty member outside of your
research area and senior PhD students.

## Authentic Opportunities to Learn Mentorship Through Mentoring

In preparation for your role as a research mentor, Duke Engineering actively
encourages and supports efforts by its PhD students to mentor undergraduates
in research work.

Our PhD students can register to serve as a mentor and post a research project
to a university-wide directory of research opportunities for undergraduates:
Muser.

As mentors, our PhD students build professional mentoring relationships with
undergraduates, while increasing undergraduate involvement in research—one of
the hallmarks of a Duke Engineering education.

## A Welcoming, Inclusive Community

By choosing Duke, you join an engaged, diverse and welcoming community that
values and supports you.

You'll notice the importance we place on faculty-doctoral student interaction.
The MEMS Graduate Student Committee plans seminars and social events—creating
a strong community among Duke MEMS doctoral students.

Through programs like PhD Plus, students learn essential skills for their
professional careers. Professional interests most often are realized through
research and technology development careers.

## A Great Location

Our engineering quad is next to the Duke University Hospital, one of the
world's leading academic medical research centers. In Durham, you'll enjoy
outstanding restaurants, a thriving arts scene, and the Eno River State Park.

The Duke campus is just miles from Research Triangle Park (RTP), home to more
than 200 major tech companies and a global hub for research.

To the west, you have the mountain towns of Asheville and Boone. To the east,
the famous beaches of the Outer Banks. The cost of living in Durham is very
affordable, much lower than Boston, New York, Atlanta, and the Bay Area.

Your Duke degree can take you anywhere in the United States and beyond. Some
students choose to remain in our Research Triangle region, which is
consistently ranked among the best places to live in the United States.

More about Certificates, Fellowships & Training Programs »

Entering with Master of Science (MS) Completed

    

Students entering the PhD program with a master's degree from another
institution should consult the Duke MEMS director of graduate studies and
their advisor for possible substitution of other courses and/or waivers of
some of these course requirements.

Teaching Assistantships

    

PhD students complete two semesters of Teaching Assistantship (TA). We provide
training to help you develop your teaching skills.

It is expected that you will complete this requirement during your second
through fourth years in the PhD program. TA assignments will be based on your
background and interests, and department needs. The goal of your TA assignment
is to provide you with a meaningful teaching experience based on your career
goals.

Teaching Assistantships require 10 hours per week on average and may involve
organizing and leading discussion sections, grading homework and quizzes,
assisting in the development of course materials and supervising laboratory
sessions.
