  2. Undergraduate
  3. Degrees

Focus on topics related to biomechanics, biomaterials and bioscience

The double-major Bachelor of Science (BSE) in mechanical engineering and
biomedical engineering enables students to focus on topics related to public
health.

The ME-BME curriculum prepares students for careers related to medical
devices, public health, biopharma and biomanufacturing industries by
emphasizing the integration of engineering, biology and environmental
sciences.

This undergraduate degree program forms a solid foundation for graduate-level
work in materials science, mechanical engineering or biomedical engineering.

## Approved Courses

### 1\. Approved Physics Courses

  * Physics 151L(61L) & 152L(62L)
  * Physics 161L(41L) & Physics 162(42L)— _for students transferring in from
    Duke's Trinity College of Arts & Sciences_

#### If a Student has AP Credits

Advanced Placement (AP) credits are accepted in place of the Physics
requirements (Physics C Exams on mechanics for Physics 151L(61L) and
electricity and magnetism for Physics 152L(62L), respectively).

If students use AP credits for both courses, they must take Physics 153L(63L)
_or_ Physics 264(143).

Students may _not_ take Physics 141(61) at Duke and use AP credit for Physics
142(62).

#### More AP options

  * If no AP credit or AP score less than 4, then Physics courses 151L(61L)
    _and_ 152L(62L)
  * If Physics 141(61) is completed and AP scores of 4 to 5, then Physics
    152L(62L)
  * If Physics 141(61) and 142(62) are completed and AP scores of 4 to 5, then
    Physics 153L(63L) _or_ Physics 264(143)
  * If a pre-med student and has taken Physics 151L(61L) _and_ 152L(62L), then
    it is highly recommended to also take Physics 153L(63) (Note: Physics
    141(61) and 142(62) _do not_ cover all the materials in the MCAT.)
