Materials scientists and engineers discover, design and apply new materials to
meet the grand challenges of our time

Harvesting solar and thermal energy economically, enabling improved batteries
and quantum computing, developing improved medical treatments all require new
materials with specific properties.

### Duke's NanoTech Cleanroom

A Duke engineering undergraduate works in the cleanroom of Duke's NSF-funded
Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility (SMiF), where special lighting
protects photosensitive materials.

Earn Duke's **Certificate in Materials Science & Engineering** to learn the
scientific and engineering principles related to the fundamental structures,
properties and technological applications of materials.

Expert faculty teach from multiple disciplines, such as Mechanical Engineering
& Materials Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Biomedical
Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics.

Through a course selected from History, Public Policy or Economics, students
learn about the role of technology in science, public policy and the economy.

Upper-level undergraduate students enrolled in both the Pratt School of
Engineering and Duke's Trinity College of Arts & Sciences are eligible to
complete this certificate.

## Important Features

  * Each student is assigned an academic advisor
  * Your academic transcript will note the successful completion of this
    certificate
  * Earn academic credit through independent research with affiliated faculty
