> **The Constructal Law** | Adrian Bejan

The constructal law, stated by Duke's Adrian Bejan in 1996, is the law of
physics that accounts for the phenomenon of evolution (configuration, form,
design) throughout nature, inanimate flow systems and animate systems together

The constructal law:

  * Places the concepts of life, evolution, design and performance in physics,
    which is in the broadest scientific arena
  * Is the law of physics of life and evolution3-5
  * Accounts for the arrow of time6, which is the direction of the evolution
    of flow organization over time

## More Information

The constructal law is receiving wide acceptance in the scientific literature.

The growth of the field is documented regularly in review articles7-9,
books8-21, international Constructal Law Conferences, and independent websites
such as:

  * constructal.org
  * sciencedaily.com
  * scoop.it

## About Adrian Bejan

Adrian Bejan's research covers engineering science and applied physics:
thermodynamics, heat transfer, convection, design, and evolution in nature.

Among many honors, the Benjamin Franklin Medal was awarded to him for
thermodynamics and "constructal theory, which predicts natural design and its
evolution in engineering, scientific, and social systems.”
