# SIPP: Saving the Summer Internship

July 20, 2020 | By Carey Rudell

New Summer Industry Projects Program (SIPP) connects Duke Engineering master’s
students with real-world work experiences despite the disruption of COVID-19

In February 2020, Duke Master of Engineering Management (MEM) student Abhishek
Sathe accepted an internship offer—a decision that normally would have
confirmed his plans for the summer and given him a much-needed break from the
stress of applications and interviews. Due to the pandemic, however, the
company rescinded its offer. Sathe re-started his internship search and landed
another offer—only to see that one rescinded as well.

Unfortunately, many of Sathe’s peers across Duke Engineering master’s programs
were experiencing similar difficulties finding internships, a critical part of
their professional development and a requirement for students in the MEM and
Master of Engineering programs.

> This year we supported projects with Duke Engineering's Summer Industry
> Projects Program. One of the projects explored building a cross dock to
> support inbound sea containers of pharma & healthcare products. The
> students' hard work and passion for data convinced us that the savings to
> our customers was worth exploring. The students' poise in handling questions
> and knowledge of the business was outstanding. Their presentation was
> professional and well organized. They told a great story, backed up their
> findings and created a model that allowed people to test. Brilliant
> execution!

Recognizing the challenges they were facing due to COVID-19, Pratt School of
Engineering Executive-in-Residence Jon Reifschneider (MEM’06) sprang into
action, quickly launching the Summer Industry Projects Program (SIPP) to
provide students opportunities to work remotely and gain real-world
experience. Over 70 Duke Engineering master’s students were matched with 33
eight-week projects, including technically-oriented initiatives, such as data
analysis and software development, as well as business-oriented projects such
as market analyses for potential new products. Sponsor organizations included
large tech companies, government agencies and startups, many of them founded
or run by Duke alumni.

Abhishek Sathe was matched with a SIPP project that leveraged his interest in
data science. He and his project teammates, master’s students Sumin Lan and
Xiaoyan Liu, have been remotely collaborating on three client-based data
analyses for their project sponsor, Durham-based mobile data collection
pioneer Mi-Corporation. “The projects are very challenging—it has been a
fantastic learning opportunity,” Sathe said. He, Lan and Liu have also enjoyed
a unique benefit—daily interaction with the company’s CEO, Greg Clary (BSEE
’90; MS ’92), who has supervised their project.

Like Sathe, biomedical engineering students Moriah Garcia and Altaful Amin had
a stressful spring—both students’ internship interviews were canceled. “This
program definitely gave me some optimism back,” Garcia said. The two were
selected for a project for UCB Pharma.

“Moriah and Altaf’s work is plotting out a best practices roadmap on
influential factors to give collaborations between academia and industry the
best chance of success,” said Brittany Davis (MS’13, PhD’16), head of external
medical funding and collaborations at UCB Pharma. “UCB is formalizing its
research collaboration process and we’ll be integrating key learnings from
their research. Setting up effective research collaborations with our
innovative academic partners will enhance the impact of the research conducted
together. That being said, our Duke interns’ work will be highly valuable to
UCB with visibility across our organization.”

SIPP participants are already seeing positive results from their projects. MEM
student Weijie (Ryan) Yi, an aspiring data analyst, was selected for a market
research project with online retailer Wayfair. Due to his Wayfair experience,
Yi performed well in later interviews and received two offers for internships
that begin after SIPP ends. He accepted an opportunity with a China-based data
analysis company to intern remotely beginning in August.

In addition to career experience, SIPP has offered students professional
development. On June 1, students kicked off their projects with an orientation
program that provided training on project management, communication, and
remote collaboration skills. Later opportunities included workshops on
networking, building an online professional identity, and communicating the
value of project experiences.

Jon Reifschneider attributes much of the program’s success to the strength of
Duke’s alumni network. “So many Duke engineering alums have dedicated time to
sponsoring SIPP projects and mentoring our graduate students,” he said.
“Although they had a difficult start to their summer, we expect great outcomes
for these students.”

Thanks to its success and Duke Engineering’s continuing commitment to
providing students impactful professional development opportunities, SIPP will
return next summer, he said.
