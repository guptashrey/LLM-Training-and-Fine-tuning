# Cooling Fabrics Fight Climate Change, As Well As Sweat

November 17, 2020 | Elizabeth Witherspoon

Duke engineers are developing comfortable textiles that reduce demand for air
conditioning

Clothes that keep you cool aren’t just for exercising — or coping with
menopausal hot flashes. They actually have an important role in combatting
climate change, according to Po-Chun Hsu, assistant professor of mechanical
engineering and materials science at Duke University.

Anyone trapped in a pre-pandemic conference or classroom when the air
conditioning wasn’t lowered to account for the collective body heat of the
group can relate. In a departure from simply improving on the ability of
fabrics to wick away moisture and cool us individually through evaporation,
Hsu and his research group are reinventing the whole concept of cooling
textiles to lower the wearer’s thermal radiation so that we can tolerate
higher air conditioning settings. In turn, this saves energy and reduces the
climate impacts of energy production.

Hsu discussed their work in an article in the recent special issue of Science
magazine, titled “Keeping cool in a warming world,” and on the magazine’s
podcast.

For more information about Hsu’s work, we also invite you to listen to Duke
Engineering’s Rate of Change podcast episode, “The World’s Coolest T-Shirt.”
