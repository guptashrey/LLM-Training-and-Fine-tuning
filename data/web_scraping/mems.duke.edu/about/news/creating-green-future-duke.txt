# Creating a Green Future at Duke

April 3, 2019

Trisha Dupnock, a CEE PhD candidate, was one of seven individuals honored by
Sustainable Duke

_From Duke Today_

Trisha Dupnock, a CEE PhD candidate, was one of seven individuals honored by
Sustainable Duke for helping Duke move closer to embodying the vision of
sustainability. Dupnock received the award for "Outstanding Leadership in
Sustainability – Student."

With her actions and ideas, Dupnock has helped make the Pratt School of
Engineering greener.

An avid cyclist, Dupnock advocated for more bicycle parking on campus and
coordinated a report showing the spots where additional bike parking would be
most beneficial. She also advised a Bass Connections team on the feasibility
of a campus digester to turn waste into fuel, and conducted research on how
best to make labs more sustainable.

As chair of the Engineering Graduate Student Council, she made sustainability
a core part of its mission and even wheeled recycling bins to campus events
where they otherwise might not be.

With Pratt School of Engineering undertaking an ambitious goal of getting all
of its labs to be certified green, Dupnock has played a large role, offering
guidance to school leaders.

“When we talk about sustainability at the Pratt School of Engineering,
Trisha’s name almost always comes up in the conversation and she’s usually the
first student we look at for examples of how to be more sustainable,” wrote
nominators Marc Deshusses, Mark Schreiner and Kelly Rockwell.
