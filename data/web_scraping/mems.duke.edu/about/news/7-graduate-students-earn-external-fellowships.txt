# 7 Graduate Students Earn External Fellowships

October 6, 2017

Highly competitive national awards help graduate students conduct research

Each year, the Pratt School of Engineering encourages graduate students to
seek support from external fellowship awards. Earning these competitive
fellowships goes a long way toward helping emerging scientists conduct their
research while raising Duke Engineering’s profile and research portfolio in
turn.

This year, Duke Engineering graduate students manage to nab seven such
fellowships from two funding agencies—the National Science Foundation (NSF)
and the Department of Defense (DoD).

The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program is the oldest graduate fellowship
of its kind in the United States, with a long history of selecting recipients
who achieve high levels of success in their future academic and professional
careers. This competitive fellowship program recognizes and supports
outstanding graduate students who pursue research-based master's and doctoral
degrees at accredited United States institutions of higher learning.

The DoD offers several different fellowship opportunities, including the
National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NSDEG) Fellowship, and the
Science, Mathematics And Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for
Service Program.

The NSDEG Fellowship is awarded to applications who will pursue a doctoral
degree in one of 15 disciplines of interest to the DoD as a means of
increasing the number of U.S. citizens and nationals trained in science and
engineering disciplines of military importance. The SMART Scholarship supports
students pursuing technical degrees in STEM disciplines to increase the number
of civilian scientists and engineers working at DoD laboratories.

“These are highly competitive national programs,” said Jennifer West, the
Fitzpatrick Family University Professor of Engineering and Associate Dean for
Ph.D. Education at Duke. “It is gratifying to see the talent and hard work of
our exceptional doctoral students recognized at this level.”

Congratulations to this year’s recipients.

### Kristen Hagan – Advancing Optical Coherence Tomography

NSF Graduate Research Fellowship  
Biomedical Engineering  
Undergraduate Institution: The University of Texas at Austin  
Advisor: Joseph Izatt

_Adaptive Optics Optical Coherence Tomography_

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide high-resolution volumetric
images of the human retina in a non-invasive manner, leading to its ubiquitous
presence in ophthalmology clinics. Adaptive optics OCT (AO-OCT) systems can
increase the lateral resolution of retinal images and help correct for
patient-specific aberrations caused by the manipulation of the light's
wavefront when traveling through the eye.

### Abbi Helfer - Developing Cardiac Tissue

NSF Graduate Research Fellowship  
Biomedical Engineering  
Undergraduate Institution: University of Washington  
Advisor: Nenad Bursac

_Understanding Left-Right Patterning in Early Cardiac Development Using a
Microfluidic Platform_

The human body is not perfectly symmetrical. In fact, proper heart development
in the embryo relies on the generation of asymmetrical anterior-posterior and
left-right axes. However, most in vitro studies of human heart development
fail to incorporate the asymmetrical patterning seen in gastrulation. I
propose to generate a microfluidic platform capable of modeling anterior-
posterior and left-right axes in a population of human stem cells by using
spatiotemporally controlled gradients of signaling molecules. This platform
would allow us to better understand the role that asymmetry plays in the
earliest stages of heart development.

### Anastasia Varanko - Drug Depots for Sustained Delivery

NSF Graduate Research Fellowship  
Biomedical Engineering  
Undergraduate Institution: Cornell University  
Advisor: Ashutosh Chilkoti

_Molecular Drug Depots for Sustained Antibody Delivery_

My project focuses on using elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) to create
subcutaneous antibody depots for continuous, long-term release of therapeutic
antibodies. The technology fuses antibiotics to a heat-sensitive ELP in a
solution that can be injected into the skin through a standard needle. Once
injected, the solution reacts with body heat to form a biodegradable gel-like
"depot" that slowly releases the drug as it dissolves.

### Veronica Gough - Single Base Editing for mRNA Splicing

NSF Graduate Research Fellowship  
Biomedical Engineering  
Undergraduate Institution: Rice University  
Advisor: Charlie Gersbach

_Single Base Editing to Investigate mRNA Splicing_

The improper splicing of mRNA transcripts can cause diseases such as Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD). The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a tool for editing the
genome at specific loci that can be used to restore mRNA transcripts, but the
conventional enzyme generates breaks that result in random mutations in the
DNA. A new system has been developed to precisely and efficiently edit single
DNA bases, and this "base editor" will be targeted to the regions that
regulate mRNA splicing. By making single base changes at these locations, we
will study how splice sites can be modified to regulate mRNA splicing and
develop an exon-skipping strategy to correct DMD.

### Jon Stewart – Plasmonic Nanoantennas

NSDEG Fellowship  
Electrical and Computer Engineering  
Undergraduate Institution: University of Colorado at Boulder  
Advisor: Maiken Mikkelsen

_Infrared Enhancement of Thin-Film Silicon Photodetectors with Plasmonic
Nanoantennas_

The goal of the proposed research is to understand and leverage control of
light-matter interactions in plasmonic nanomaterials for optoelectronic
devices. Plasmonics is a growing field that studies when light under specific
conditions can excite plasmons, i.e. collective charge oscillations of
electrons that are confined to metal surfaces. When this plasmon decays, the
energy from the collective electron oscillation is imparted to a single hot
electron. Metallic nanostructures can thus be designed to increase the
absorption of light at wavelengths which correspond to the plasmon resonance
of the nanostructures as well as efficiently generate hot electrons for
photodetection. Further insight into these two aspects may enable a range of
photonic and optoelectronic devices with new or improved functionalities. The
key research objectives are to (1) elucidate plasmon interactions in sub-10 nm
structures at optical frequencies, (2) demonstrate a plasmonic-enhanced
infrared silicon photodetector with higher quantum efficiencies than
previously shown, and (3) investigate previous claims about the preferential
excitement of electrons near the Fermi energy by plasmon decay.

### Kevin McHugh - Modeling Large Deflection Nonlinearities

SMART Scholarship  
Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science  
Undergraduate Institution: Lafayette College  
Advisor: Earl Dowell

_Modelling Large Deflection Nonlinearities in Beams and Plates for Aeroelastic
Analyses_

During the design process for a structure moving relative to a fluid,
engineers must consider dynamic instabilities from the fluid-structure
interaction. While widely studied for its criticality to system design, many
analyses use overly simplified linear methods. With the advent of
nonconventional composite materials used for lightweight structures and with
the growing need for highly deflected or even folded and deployable
structures, these linear techniques are not sufficient. During my time at Duke
University in Professor Earl Dowell's aeroelasticity research group, I have
studied nonlinearities associated with structures undergoing large (nonlinear)
deflections. By developing a three-dimensional, nonlinear fluid-structure
interaction mathematical model for highly deflected beams, plates and shells,
I am able to study dynamic instabilities and responses of complex geometries.
My plans are to now eliminate dynamic instabilities of military structures
such as aircraft rotors, wings, and turbomachine blades.

### Jim Turner - Machine Learning for Robotic Control

NSDEG Fellowship  
Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science  
Undergraduate Institution: North Carolina State University  
Advisor: Brian Mann

_Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Constrained Underactuated Nonlinear
Dynamical Systems_

Limitations on control, such as underactuation and power, stress, and torque
constraints, are common to most robotics problems. Engineers often avoid these
constraints by adding powerful actuators and using strong components, but this
increases weight, bulkiness, energy consumption and cost. Naive reinforcement
learning techniques can help robots learn subject to constraints, but they
require the robot to accumulate a lot of data through experience. My research
interest is to develop practical learning techniques which function
effectively for constrained nonlinear systems with limited data. Enabling
robotic systems to learn quickly will enhance their adaptability to new and
unfriendly environments, reduce energy expenditure, increase agility and
expand their capabilities to more complex tasks.

outrageously ambitious
