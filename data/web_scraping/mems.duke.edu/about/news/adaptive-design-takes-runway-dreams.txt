# Adaptive Design Takes Off on Runway of Dreams

February 8, 2021 | Duke Arts

Engineering meets innovation and accessibility in virtual adaptive fashion
show featuring people with disabilities

We all have that one outfit that makes us feel unstoppable. Maybe it’s a power
suit, a little black dress, a comfortable pair of jeans, or the most
supportive running shoes. Whatever it is, clothing has a direct impact on how
we feel and how we express ourselves. Unfortunately, however, mainstream
clothing can present challenges that prevent people with disabilities from
having choice in what they show up to the world wearing.

To solve this problem, fashion meets engineering, innovation and
accessibility.

> "I became consumed with the idea of creating innovations that would give
> people with disabilities autonomy while dressing themselves and the ability
> to feel confident in what they’re wearing."

Emma Steadman ('22), an undergraduate mechanical engineering major in Duke
University's Pratt School of Engineering, co-founded and is president of
Runway of Dreams at Duke, an affiliate of the national nonprofit foundation
Runway of Dreams. In collaboration with the Runway of Dreams chapter at North
Carolina State University, she is co-hosting the premiere of "Coming Together,
Creating Change," a virtual adaptive fashion show Thursday, February 11, at 7
p.m., on Facebook. The show will feature models who have a variety of
disabilities and range in ages 3-36, who are strutting down their own personal
runways from across the country.

Read more about this innovative design work to improve accessibility and
people's lives at Duke Arts.
