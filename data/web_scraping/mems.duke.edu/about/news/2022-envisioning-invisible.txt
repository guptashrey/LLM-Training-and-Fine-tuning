# Cellular Filaments, Bacterial 'Easter Eggs,' Solar Panel Fungi Win 2022
Envisioning the Invisible Image Contest

March 15, 2022

Image contest at Duke explores and explains the world around us

The 2022 edition of the regular "Envisioning the Invisible" image contest took
place on the evening of Tuesday, March 15, 2022. Sharing honors from the
selection committee were three fantastic images:

  * **Nathan Rayens** , a PhD student in the MEMS department working in the
    laboratory of Christine Payne, was selected for his image of cellular
    filaments that provide cells with support and organization, and sometimes
    make Nathan feel like he's being watched back
  * PhD students **Zach Holmes** and **Yuanchi Ha** , along with postdoctoral
    fellow **Andrea Weiss** , all members of the BME laboratory of Lingchong
    You, were selected for bacterial communities trapped in hydrogel capsules
    that look like decorated eggs
  * **Michael Valerino** , a CEE PhD student in the laboratory of Mike Bergin,
    was selected for his photo of twisting fungi reminiscent of a vine
    strangling a tree that somehow manages to survive on the 140-degree F
    surface of a solar panel

Two more awards were given for audience choice selections:

  * BME PhD student **Vardhman Kumar** , working in the laboratory of Shyni
    Varghese, won recognition for his photo of "DraBot," a soft robotic
    dragonfly that is powered by fluid pressure via microchannels embedded
    within its body
  * The second audience choice award went to **August Burns** , departmental
    business manager for the Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics, for a long-
    exposure photo of an Outer Banks fishing boat run ashore cleverly
    illuminated by Burns to look like an ancient ghostship

Coordinated by the Duke Engineering Graduate Student Council, the contest is
designed to help explore and explain the world around us. Duke faculty, staff
and students are invited to submit their best images for consideration.

Besides awarding four cash prizes, a committee chooses a number of photos to
be displayed in an installation in the Atrium of the Fitzpatrick Center.
Selected images from previous contest years are on permanent display on Level
1 of the Wilkinson Building. Selected images can also be viewed online at
arts.pratt.duke.edu.
