# New Master’s Degree Applies AI to Product Innovation

August 13, 2020

The industry-focused Master of Engineering program launches in Fall 2021 with
both online and on-campus options

Increases in computing power, storage capacity and research funding are
fueling a dramatic evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and expanding the
field beyond university research and large tech companies. In every industry,
from biomedical to aerospace, engineering teams are integrating AI into
products and systems.

Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering is launching a new graduate
degree program to address the talent gap created by this remarkable growth.
Beginning in fall 2021, Duke Engineering’s Master of Engineering in Artificial
Intelligence for Product Innovation will equip early-career engineers and
scientists with the skills to bring artificial intelligence innovation to
product and service development.

> The degree can be completed within 12 months, and is expected to attract
> early-career engineers and scientists from diverse fields

Duke Engineering’s world-class machine-learning research, strong
interdisciplinary environment, and close industry relations uniquely position
the school to prepare high-potential future AI leaders.

“The strength of Duke’s reputation in AI and Machine Learning, combined with
the focus on applying these technologies to solve the world’s challenges in
healthcare, retail, energy and beyond, make Duke the logical choice for
someone interested in pursuing education in this space,” said Tarun Thapar,
senior product manager-personalization with Wayfair and 2015 Duke engineering
master’s graduate.

The new program is guided by a cross-departmental steering committee of
faculty experts in the theory and application of AI, together with an advisory
board of AI leaders from diverse industries to ensure the program continues to
evolve along with industry needs.

The program’s director, Jon Reifschneider, joined Duke from the analytics
company DTN, where he was senior vice president overseeing development of
advanced predictive analytics products upon which major U.S. energy and
transportation providers rely. Reifschneider’s background gives him an
excellent vantage point on the value of the new degree program.

“What sets our new AI for Product Innovation program apart is the unique
combination of education in AI theory and implementation coupled with a strong
focus on hands-on learning about applications of AI within industries such as
health care and energy,” he said. “We designed our curriculum from the ground
up with significant input from industry partners and structured our novel core
course sequence around the product development process, providing students a
strong foundation in the technical aspects of AI but also an understanding of
the business, legal and ethical context in which the technology is applied.
Our students complete their experience with a two-semester industry capstone
project, enabling them to gain deep experience in applying AI within their
field of interest.”

The new program can be completed within 12 months and is expected to attract
early-career engineers and scientists from diverse fields who want to leverage
AI to make a greater impact in their industry. It is, however, also accessible
to participants from technical fields who may not have an extensive prior
computing background. Through the course of the program, students will develop
a strong understanding of both the theory and hands-on implementation of
machine learning and AI.

> Online students will have access to the same faculty and courses as Duke
> students on campus

In addition to the full-time on-campus master’s program, Duke Engineering is
launching an online version of the degree. Professionals who want to continue
working while pursuing graduate education will have access to the same faculty
and courses as students in the on-campus equivalent.

“We are seeing significant growth in demand among working professionals for
online education in major interdisciplinary technology areas such as AI,” said
Jeff Glass, the senior associate dean for education and learning innovation at
Duke Engineering. “We have responded to this high level of interest through
the introduction of online versions of our new master’s programs in AI,
Financial Technology (FinTech), and Cybersecurity, which offer flexibility
while preserving the same intimate, tailored, world-class educational
experience valued by our on-campus students.”

The Duke Master of Engineering in AI for Product Innovation program is now
accepting applications for August 2021.
