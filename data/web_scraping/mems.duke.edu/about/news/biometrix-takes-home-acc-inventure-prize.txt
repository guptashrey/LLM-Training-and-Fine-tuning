# BioMetrix Takes Home ACC InVenture Prize

April 7, 2016

BioMetrix, a startup company co-founded by Duke undergraduate Ivonna Dumanyan,
has won the inaugural ACC InVenture Prize.

Held at Georgia Tech, the competition involved student teams from each of the
15 universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Modeled after the hit TV
show "Shark Tank," the event features a pitch competition whereby a team of
undergraduates representing each ACC university pitched their invention or
business before a live audience and a panel of judges.

The preliminary round featuring 15 teams took place on April 5, and the five
finalists competed in a program broadcast live on television and streamed
online on the evening of April 6.

BioMetrix won first place and $15,000 by inventing a way to keep athletes and
sports teams healthier. A wearable sensor adheres to the skin, collects data
and uses cloud services to quantify rehabilitation progress and provide real-
time feedback to reduce athletic injuries.

Dumanyan and co-inventor Gabrielle Levac, who graduated from Trinity in 2014,
have spent the past two years developing and testing the device through the
help of a Smart Home Fellowship and the Innovation Co-Lab, which offers a
grant program for building the next wave of technology for the Duke Community.

Incoming dean of the Pratt School of Engineering Ravi Bellamkonda was among
the Georgia Tech faculty who created the new Inventure Prize to stimulate
undergraduate entrepreneurial activity and increase student-faculty
engagement, to celebrate and highlight the exceptional creativity and
ingenuity of students, and to inspire a greater sense of camaraderie across
the schools of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

outrageously ambitious
