# GREENgineering: Duke Bleeds GREEN

March 1, 2020 | By Asha Mallapragada

Initiated by Dean Ravi Bellamkonda, GREENgineering is working toward a greener
and more sustainable Pratt School of Engineering

The time to start working on a sustainable future has passed, and if we
continue doing nothing today, future generations will bear the brunt of our
actions. GREENgineering is an initiative that thinks, talks, and works toward
a greener and more sustainable Pratt School of Engineering.

The program was initiated by Ravi Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean of the Pratt School
of Engineering, who believes sustainability is a generational responsibility.
A few months ago, Dean Bellamkonda challenged the Pratt community to become
more sustainable, and now the initiative has assumed a life of its own.

When Dean Bellamkonda first expressed interest in an initiative to work toward
a sustainable Pratt, a couple of faculty and staff convened to discuss the end
goals and potential initiatives to achieve them. "I felt like I wasn't doing
enough and wanted to make myself accountable," says Kelly Rockwell, founding
co-chair of GREENgineering along with civil and environmental engineering
associate professor Lee Ferguson. "GREENgineering is a great community of very
passionate people who want to bring real change in our environment, no matter
how small or large. I wanted to be a part of that. This is a great group for
everyone who wants to make an impact."

Initiative members comprise Pratt staff, faculty and students, who have the
sole intention of making the university more environmentally friendly.
Established in April 2019, the team has already been successful in identifying
faculty and staff leaders who can facilitate green certification. With their
help, any student or faculty can get their laboratories, classrooms,
workspaces or events green-certified through the GREENgineering website.

Green certification provides practical ways to incorporate sustainability,
waste reduction and efficient energy usage for staff and students. Under the
initiative, the number of bottle-filling water fountains has been increased
and disposable plastic bottles sold through vending machines have been
removed. The initiative encourages carpooling, turning off computers outside
of work hours and using sustainable vendors—actions that could reduce carbon
emissions and increase fuel efficiency.

Outside of Pratt's facilities, there is so much an individual can do. The
choice of not consuming single-use plastic can produce a significant impact.
For anyone interested in taking an active part in GREENgineering, their
official website serves as a valuable resource. The location of cardboard,
battery, styrofoam and plastic film recycling bins are listed on the website.
The process to get a laboratory, workspace, classroom, event or course green-
certified is also expounded in detail. A compiled 'green vendors' list and
greenevent planning tips for anyone on the campus organizing an event can be
found on the website. The team welcomes anyone who wants to volunteer to make
Pratt greener or is interested in creating awareness about sustainability or
GREEN initiatives.

The crucial challenge that currently stands before GREENgineering is
unawareness, a problem that cannot be solved theoretically. According to the
team, knowledge on the effects of single-use plastics and styrofoam, and their
role in waste management, must be increased. People should know about the
initiatives within Pratt that work toward a greener tomorrow. The team is
working toward overcoming these challenges.

The GREENgineering committee members meet once a month, and in between those
meetings, the subcommittees meet. These meetings consist of actionable items
and an examination of potential plans. GREENgineering is currently discussing
the means to communicate to the Pratt community about recycling, composting
and other sustainable options. In the spring term, the team will work on
promoting Duke's recycling program to generate more impact. The initiative is
also looking at developing systems that measure and report energy savings and
creating a bicycle shelter. Pratt has not waited for another school to start
somewhere. As a Pratt student, don't wait for someone to do something, because
we possess the potential to initiate a change.

> "All of these initiatives might be a small drop in a bucket, but the drops
> add. Likewise, the actions of people exert a cascading effect. Change does
> not happen in theory. We thought we needed to implement changes in our
> sphere of action and work as much as we can to generate maximum impact. The
> exclusive way to achieve that was to start, agree on a set of actions, work,
> face problems, learn from them, experiment, adapt and do it again
> differently. Because it is our responsibility to take care of the earth
> while we are here, so the subsequent generations are not burdened. After
> all, we have benefited from the actions of the previous generations."
