Journey

February 15, 2021 | Ricky Hollenbach

Learning this martial art have taught Ricky Hollenbach about goal setting,
discipline, and more that he applies to earning a PhD in Mechanical

and medals at the national and international levels–lessons he applies as he
earns a PhD in Mechanical Engineering.
