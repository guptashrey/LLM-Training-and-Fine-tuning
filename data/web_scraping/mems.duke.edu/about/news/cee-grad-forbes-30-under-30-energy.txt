# CEE Graduate Named a Forbes '30 Under 30' in Energy

November 14, 2018

Megan O'Connor PhD '17 is the cofounder of Nth Cycle, a company that helps
recycle rare earth metals from used electronics

Megan O'Connor, CEE '17, has been named a _Forbes_ "30 Under 30" in Energy for
2019. O'Connor started a company called Nth Cycle that uses carbon nanotube
filters to separate different elements found in e-waste and electronics
manufacturing streams.

_Forbes_ 's Chris Helman writes, "O'Connor has devised a novel, more
environmentally friendly method of recycling valuable metals using carbon
nanotube filters the size of a water bottle to extract materials like cobalt
and lithium from an acid bath of dissolved discarded electronics. O’Connor,
28, believes nanotube filters will make it cheaper for electronics makers to
buy recycled metals than newly mined supplies, and with one tenth the energy
input."
