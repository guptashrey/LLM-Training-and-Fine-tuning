# Lambrou and Latner Win 2015 Merritt Science Journalism Award

March 31, 2015

The new award honors Duke students for the best piece of science journalism

Duke seniors **Anastasia Lambrou** and **Joshua Latner** have won the
inaugural Richard Merritt Jr. Memorial Award for Excellence in Science
Journalism for their video “EbolaChat.”

Established in 2014 in memory of longtime Duke science writer Richard Merritt,
the new annual award honors Duke graduate or undergraduate students for the
best piece of science journalism produced during the previous calendar year.

The award was presented to Lambrou and Latner on Monday, March 30, at a dinner
celebration that also honored the recipients of the University’s 2015 Melcher
and Futrell Awards for journalistic excellence.

The selection committee, comprising science communications leaders across the
University, praised the team’s video as “a creatively produced, accessible and
compelling video that met its goal of educating high-schoolers and the general
public about Ebola thanks to the producers’ sound understanding of how to
communicate clearly about a complex scientific topic.” Latner and Lambrou
received certificates commemorating their accomplishment and a shared
honorarium of $500.

Honorable mentions in the competition were Can Humans Hibernate? Ask the Dwarf
Lemur, a Scientific American blog post by biology graduate student **Sheena
Faherty** , and Engineering Low-cost Methods to Assess Water Safety in South
Africa, a series of posts on the Duke Global Health Institute Diaries from the
Field Blog by biomedical engineering major **Brittany Davis**.
