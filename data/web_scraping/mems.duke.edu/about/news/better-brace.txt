# Designing and 3D-Printing a Better Brace

September 17, 2019

Duke Engineering senior Anuj Thakkar and mechanical engineer/teaching
assistant Atanaz Bohlooli design, modify and test a 3D-printed cast for Anuj's
wrist

Almost exactly one year ago to the day, Anuj Thakkar got into an unfortunate
biking accident and was left with a broken wrist. It soon became evident that
not only would he have to deal with the pain of a broken wrist, but he would
also have to deal with the discomfort of a cloth cast. After a couple of weeks
of dealing with the consequences of a sweaty cast that could not get wet
during one of the rainiest weeks of the month, Anuj had had enough.

Luckily for Anuj, he was a junior in mechanical engineering at the time, and
he became determined to improve his situation. That’s when Anuj decided to
approach his friend Atanaz Bohlooli, a mechanical engineering and teaching
assistant, to ask if she would be interested in collaborating on a project to
engineer a wrist brace to alleviate the pain and discomfort. From then on, the
two worked together to create a custom-fit, flexible, waterproof wrist brace
to be 3D printed for Anuj to wear in place of his initial cloth cast.

After about three months of design, modification and testing, the two created
a final product. By using a white light scanner, 3D CAD software and a
Stratasys 3D printer, the wrist brace was durable and ready to be worn. The
cast turned out to be a huge success, even garnering doctor approval, which
allowed Anuj to wear the wrist brace for the next two months. One fully-healed
wrist, and a lot of learning later, Atanaz and Anuj continue to pursue
engineering projects and push the barriers of conventional engineering.

outrageously ambitious
