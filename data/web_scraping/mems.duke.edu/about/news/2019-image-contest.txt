# Bacterial Blooms Win 2019 'Envisioning the Invisible' Contest

February 25, 2019

Annual contest is designed to help explore and explain the world around us.

The 8th Annual "Envisioning the Invisible" image contest took place on the
evening of Friday, February 22, 2019. Taking first place this year was Nan
Luo, a postdoctoral researcher in biomedical engineering, with an array of
bacterial "blooms" that spontaneously form when bacteria collectively grow
into different shapes and patterns depending on their environmental
conditions.

Nikki Votaw and Chelsea Fries, doctoral students in biomedical engineering,
took second place with a heightmap showing the contours of nanofibers taken on
an atomic force microscope.

Fioleda Kesseli, a postdoctoral researcher in mechanical engineering and
materials science, won third place with a blooming structure of directionally
freeze-dried chitosan taken with a scanning electron microscope.

Michael Valerino, a doctoral student in environmental engineering, received
the "Audience Choice" award for his electron microscope image of dust
particles taken from Gandhinagar, India.

Coordinated by our Engineering Graduate Student Council, the contest is
designed to help explore and explain the world around us. Each year, Duke
faculty, staff and students are invited to submit their best images for
consideration. Besides awarding four cash prizes, the committee chooses a
number of photos to be displayed in an art installation in FCIEMAS and online
at envisioning.pratt.duke.edu.

outrageously ambitious
