# Nightingale Named to NIBIB National Advisory Council

August 4, 2020 | By Michaela Kane

Kathy Nightingale will join the council, which provides biomedical expertise
to the leaders of various health organizations

Kathy Nightingale, the Theo Pilkington Distinguished Professor of Biomedical
Engineering, has been appointed to the National Advisory Council for the
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).

As a member of the National Advisory Council, Nightingale and her colleagues
will advise the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS), the assistant secretary for health of DHHS, and the director of NIBIB
on topics that involve the conduct and support of research, training, health
information dissemination and other programs that address biomedical
engineering, biomedical imaging and associated technologies and modalities
with biomedical applications. They will also advise on policy and program
priorities.

As a professor in Duke BME, Nightingale and her lab develop ultrasonic imaging
methods to address clinically-relevant problems. They have pioneered the
development and clinical translation of acoustic radiation force impulse
(ARFI)-based elasticity imaging methods, which generate images of the
mechanical properties of tissues.

“I am honored to have been invited to serve on this council, and I’m looking
forward to helping shape the strategic vision of the NIBIB in these coming
years,” says Nightingale.

outrageously ambitious
