# Solutions for Seedling Sunburn, Runaway Trash Bins and Other Woes

December 7, 2021

First-year design teams develop solutions for real clients with real problems,
like crop loss and decreased mobility

EGR 101, First-Year Design, gives Duke students an initial taste of what it’s
like to work as a professional engineer. Students choose from a plethora of
challenges that have been brought to instructors by clients in the community,
and work in consultation with that client to design—and redesign—solutions
that meet the clients’ needs, developing and honing communication skills
alongside technical know-how. After the students make a final presentation to
their clients, they must run a final gauntlet: answering questions from peers,
professors and others, both inside and outside of the School of Engineering,
about their prototypes at a public poster session.

These are just a few of the many ingenious projects that student teams
presented in early December, 2021:
