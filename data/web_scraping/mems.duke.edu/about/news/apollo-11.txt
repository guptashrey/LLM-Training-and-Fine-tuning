# The Duke Engineering Women Who Helped Launch Apollo 11

July 17, 2019

Two Duke engineers had the time of their lives helping to pull off Neil
Armstrong's "small step"

_From Duke Magazine's "The Blue Note"_

Fifty years ago this month, Apollo 11 launched from Florida’s Kennedy Space
Center and Neil Armstrong took his “small step.” And, on the team it took to
pull off such a historic feat were three Duke alumnae, including two Duke
Engineers.

Joining Julie Isherwood (WC’68) on the Apollo program were Parrish Nelson
Hirasaki (E’67) and Lindsay Robinson (E’67). And by their telling, they had
the time of their lives doing it.

“Our families thought we were rock stars,” says Hirasaki, with delight in her
voice. “Even though I was part of a large group, they would tell people the
astronauts couldn’t have gone to the moon without me.”

The women worked for TRW, an aerospace contractor for NASA, and were based in
Houston. Hirasaki did the calculations for the command module’s heat shield, a
critical piece in protecting the astronauts as the module re-entered Earth’s
atmosphere. Isherwood was a kind of trouble-shooter; she worked in the
trajectory analysis division, helping to generate the abort parameters, and
later, on lunar ascent and descent. Or in simple terms for non-rocket
scientists: “If astronauts saw our numbers, they were in real big trouble,”
she says. Robinson worked with computer simulations for the electrical power
systems on the lunar, command, and service modules.

To learn more about the experiences and career paths of these women
trailblazers, check out the full story on Duke Magazine's "The Blue Note."
