# Autonomous Beta-Test Toilet Up and Running in India

October 20, 2016

Researchers from Duke recently helped install a beta prototype for a self-
contained, off-the-grid toilet system to serve the billions of people
worldwide who don’t have access to adequate sanitation.

RTI International, in conjunction with Duke University and Colorado State
University, recently installed its beta prototype for a self-contained, off-
the-grid toilet system to serve the billions of people worldwide who don’t
have access to adequate sanitation.

Part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s “Reinvent the Toilet”
challenge, the beta prototype has many improvements over its older sibling.
Enhancements have been made to the liquid processing, liquid-solid separation
system, solid mass drying system and combustion chamber. A new process control
system was implemented, making the new system much more autonomous than its
predecessor.

The new sanitation system was installed at the CEPT University in Ahmedabad,
where the original has been collecting data for more than a year. Researchers
from all sides hope the new beta version will provide even more data and bring
them closer to realizing their goal of providing a self-sufficient sanitation
system that people will actually want to use.

“This is the first fully automated test run for our experimental toilet in
India, and we’re all very excited,” said Jeff Glass, professor of electrical
and computer engineering and mechanical engineering and materials science at
Duke, who has led the team responsible for the liquid disinfection technology.
“This is a huge milestone for the overall project led by RTI that is very
important to all of us that are involved.”

outrageously ambitious
