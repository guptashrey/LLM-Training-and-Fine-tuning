# A Look Back on the Discovery of Metamaterials

May 28, 2015

Sir John Pendry of Imperial College London recently visited co-founder of the
field David R. Smith at Duke University

In the past 15 years, metamaterials has brought breakthroughs like
invisibility cloaks, acoustic cloaks, miniaturized flat antennas, and you-
don’t-have-to-stop-anymore airport security screenings. Sir John Pendry of
Imperial College London recently visited co-founder of the field David R.
Smith at Duke University to see how his students are continuing their work and
to discuss the birth, evolution and future of this novel class of materials.

The video below captures a piece of that visit, as well as the two long-time
colleagues reminicing about the early days of metamaterials research.

Learn more about the amazing things being done with metamaterials.

Watch the full discussion on the first 15 years of metamaterials.
