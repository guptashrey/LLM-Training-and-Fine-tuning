# Bespoke Bones

May 8, 2019

Mechanical engineering professor Ken Gall uses a patient's CT scans to
customize a 3D-printed titanium implant

Ken Gall, Duke Engineering's new associate dean for entrepreneurship and the
founder of 3D printing company restor3d, was recently charged with designing
and printing a custom titanium implant for a young patient who had suffered
critical damage to a bone in her lower leg during a vehicle accident.

"Many centers would have probably amputated,” said Duke orthopaedic surgeon
Samuel Adams, MD. “I immediately thought of implanting a 3D-printed cage to
replace the lost bone.”

Working with Adams, Gall's group used the patient's CT scans to inform the
fabrication and design of a scaffold that can support the patient's weight
while she heals and grows new bone around the titanium structure.

Read about the outcome on Duke Clinical Practice Today.
