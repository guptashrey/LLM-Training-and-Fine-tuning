# Six Duke Engineers Named to Global Highly Cited List

November 16, 2021

Annual Clarivate Analytics list includes 38 Duke researchers

The list of Highly Cited Researchers for 2021 includes six Duke engineering
professors spanning all four Pratt School of Engineering departments: Charles
Gersbach (BME), David Mitzi (MEMS), Yiran Chen (ECE), Stefano Curtarolo
(MEMS), David Smith (ECE) and Mark Wiesner (CEE). The researchers are
internationally recognized for their work in fields including genomics,
metamaterials and engineering physics, computer engineering, materials
science, environmental impacts and machine learning. Overall, the list
includes 38 of Duke University's most prominent and influential researchers.

Peak achievement in the sciences isn’t measured by stopwatches or goals
scored, it goes by citations – the number of times other scientists have
referenced your findings in their own academic papers. A high number of
citations is an indication that a particular work was influential in moving
the field forward.

And the peak of this peak is the annual “Highly Cited Researchers” list
produced each year by the folks at Clarivate, who run the Institute for
Scientific Information. The names on this list are drawn from publications
that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and publication year in the Web
of Science™ citation index – the most-cited of the cited.
