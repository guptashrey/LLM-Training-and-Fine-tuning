# Yiyang Gong Named 2016 Beckman Young Investigator

July 13, 2016

Assistant professor of biomedical engineering, electrical and computer
engineering, and neurobiology at Duke

Yiyang Gong, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, electrical and
computer engineering, and neurobiology at Duke University, has been named a
2016 Beckman Young Investigator by the Beckman Foundation.

The $750,000, four-year award will support Gong’s research into understanding
how neurons in the brain work together on millisecond timescales. In recent
research, Gong created an ultrafast protein sensor that can optically detect
action potentials between neurons in live mice and flies. Building on that
work, Gong will create a set of new protein and optical tools that will
quickly record and stimulate neural activity.

Arnold O. Beckman took his love of science from the makeshift laboratory he
made in his father’s barn at age 10 to the halls of the scientific instrument
company he founded, Beckman Instruments. Considered one of the top five
inventors of scientific instruments, Beckman invented the precursor to the
modern pH meter—an invention that eventually earned him a place in the
National Inventors Hall of Fame and a National Medal of Science, among other
honors.

The award program that bears Beckman’s name is intended to provide research
support to the most promising young faculty members in the early stages of
academic careers in the chemical and life sciences. It is particularly aimed
to foster the invention of methods, instruments and materials that will open
up new avenues of research in science.
