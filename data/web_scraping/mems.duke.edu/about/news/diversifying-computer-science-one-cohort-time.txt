# Diversifying Computer Science, One Cohort at a Time

February 19, 2021

Professional development program provides expert training in identity-
inclusive topics to improve computing diversity, equity and inclusion

This month, Duke's new Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) professional
development program welcomed 144 fellows to its inaugural cohort.

The fellows represent 67 different organizations across four countries, and
include public school officials, high school teachers and even museum
employees in addition to graduate students and university IT staff.

Shaundra Daily, a Duke associate professor of the practice in Electrical and
Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science, and Cecilé Sadler, a graduate
student in Duke ECE, have joined forces with Nicki Washington, Duke professor
of the practice of Computer Science and 3C's director, to develop and deliver
the program's curriculum.

It will provide expert training in identity-inclusive topics to improve
computing diversity, equity and inclusion, and will cover ways of
understanding race and gender, white supremacy, intersectionality and various
forms of oppression, as well as how that knowledge can improve computer
science in practice.
