# A New Home for Duke BME

August 6, 2015

The newly space in the Fitzpatrick Center includes 16 offices, reception area,
mailroom, breakroom, file storage, and 30-seat conference room

Duke Biomedical Engineering faculty, staff and students gathered Wednesday
evening to celebrate the opening of the department’s new administrative office
suite.

Located inside the Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering,
Medicine and Applied Sciences (CIEMAS), the newly renovated space includes 16
offices, a welcoming reception area, a workstation, mailroom, break room,
files storage room, and 30-seat conference room.

The renovation was designed to consolidate the administrative offices of Duke
Engineering’s largest department, while providing Duke BME with a signature
space.

“Duke BME has been a premier department for the university, and consistently
ranked among the top five in the nation, since its founding more than forty
years ago,” said Tom Katsouleas, Vinik Dean of the Pratt School of
Engineering, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. “This beautiful new space is
located in a facility where many of our BME faculty conduct cutting-edge
research, and we anticipate that the new space will lead to new synergies for
the department while speaking to what a flagship program BME is for Pratt and
for Duke.”

Ashutosh Chilkoti, chair of Duke BME, called it a “fantastic new space that
turned out even better than we all expected.”

The project team included Clark Nexsen, Architects; DPR Construction; Duke
Office of Project Management and Pratt Facilities.

outrageously ambitious
