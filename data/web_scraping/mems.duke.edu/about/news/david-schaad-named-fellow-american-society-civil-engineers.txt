# David Schaad Named Fellow of American Society of Civil Engineers

March 2, 2017

Schaad is a professor of the practice of civil and environmental engineering
at Duke

David Schaad, professor of the practice of civil and environmental engineering
at Duke, has been elected a Fellow in the American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE). Schaad joins the fewer than 3.5 percent of members to hold the
prestigious honor recognizing those who have made celebrated contributions and
developed creative solutions that have enhanced lives.

Schaad was recognized for his specialties in both hazardous waste
management/site remediation and water supply/wastewater engineering. After 15
years working for various engineering firms, Schaad joined Duke to invest in
the next generation of leaders by developing their design skills and ability
to move from thinking to conceptualization to implementation.

Since joining the faculty, Schaad has developed a course focused on response
to natural disasters, leading teams to both Southeast Asia and New Orleans. He
helped establish Duke Engineers for International Development, a student group
that works in collaboration with local partners to address identified
community needs. He also recently led the effort to establish a new
Certificate in Global Development Engineering.

Schaad currently serves as president of the Eastern Branch of the ASCE North
Carolina Section. He is also a diplomate of the American Academy of Water
Resources Engineers, a Board Certified Environmental Engineer (American
Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists), a licensed contractor (and
qualifier) in Building, Highways and Public Utilities in the State of North
Carolina, and a registered professional engineer in twenty-one states.

outrageously ambitious
