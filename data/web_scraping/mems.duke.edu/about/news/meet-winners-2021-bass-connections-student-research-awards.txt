# Meet the Winners of the 2021 Bass Connections Student Research Awards

April 15, 2021

Three biomedical engineering students will recieve support from the Bass
Connections program to pursue innovative research projects

This story originally appeared on the Bass Connections website.

Ten graduate students and fourteen undergraduates will pursue faculty-mentored
research projects this summer and next year with grant funding from Bass
Connections. These projects explore a diverse range of topics, including
access to modern contraception, equity in early childhood autism spectrum
disorders services, the implementation of a virtual family wellness
intervention for COVID-19, biomedical device design and innovation, and
barriers to men’s healthy engagement on college campuses.

Bass Connections Student Research Awards provide support for students to
pursue self-directed research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor.
Student projects can be either individual or collaborative in nature, and many
projects continue an aspect of research begun on a Bass Connections project
team. Some students will be pursuing collaborative projects that tackle
interdisciplinary challenges that are not directly related to a specific
project team’s research.

  * **Mohanapriya Cumaran** ’23 (Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience) is a
    member of the Gene Therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease team, where she
    examined CRISPR-Cas9 and viral vectors and their roles in creating a gene-
    editing therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The project, "Breaking the
    Delivery Barrier: Fulfilling Gene Therapy's Promises with Split Intein
    Systems," will further the team’s efforts to build a gene-editing therapy
    targeting the APOE gene involved in AD. Creating a successful model would
    sidestep the viral capacity barrier and enable the construction of more
    robust gene editing therapies. Boris Kantor will serve as faculty mentor.
  * **Suraj Upadhya** ’23 (Biomedical Engineering) is a member of the Gene
    Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease team, which has been working for two years
    to explore gene therapies and their application in Alzheimer’s disease,
    including ethical questions related to affordability and access. In order
    to advance the understanding of the interplay between neuropsychiatric
    symptoms (NPS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Upadhya plans to test the
    contribution of genetic risk variants of major depression and general
    anxiety disorders and DNA-methylation signatures to the development of
    depression and anxiety in AD patients. Ornit Chiba-Falek will serve as his
    faculty mentor.
  * **Rishabh Jain** ’22 (Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry) will work with
    other Bass Connections students to investigate healthcare disparity in the
    U.S. by studying the patient population that utilizes Remote Area Medical
    (RAM) clinics. Using empirical data from patient surveys and existing
    public health datasets, this project will characterize the RAM patient
    population and assess patient experience with care. Janet Prvu Bettger,
    Christine Everett, Truls Ostbye and Lawrence Greenblatt will serve as the
    team's faculty mentors.
