# Liu Wins ACES Award for Work in PSTD Method

April 5, 2018

The Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society conferred its highest award
to Liu for his pioneering contributions to the field

Qing Liu, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University,
was recently awarded the Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES)
Computational Electromagnetics Award for his pioneering contributions to the
Pseudospectral Time Domain (PSTD) method in computational electromagnetics.
The PSTD algorithm is used to simulate electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous,
conductive media, and due to its efficiency is ideal for parallel computation
of large-scale problems.

Liu’s research interests extend from computational electromagnetics to
acoustics, inverse problems, and their application in geophysics,
nanophotonics and biomedical imaging. He has published more than 300 refereed
journal papers in these areas.

Liu accepted the award, along with a plaque, at a ceremony that took place at
the 2018 ACES Conference in Denver, Colorado.

outrageously ambitious
