Cong Feng

Power and energy systems are transiting from fossil-based systems to systems
with large amounts of renewable energy. Compared to the traditional power
system configuration, future power systems will integrate more renewable
resources, manageable loads, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and
other energy efficient technologies. These new technologies will also bring
more uncertainty and vulnerability to the power systems. Delivering reliable,
resilient, clean, and affordable power and energy with large penetrations of
renewable energy remains to be a challenging problem. Artificial intelligence
(AI) has been applied to tackle these challenges by promoting power system
decision intelligence. This talk will mainly cover the research of applying
artificial intelligence to the sensing of the next generation energy systems:
Meteorology-informed AI for Solar Sensing. We will demonstrate how to use deep
learning, computer vision, and sky camera to enhance solar visibility and
predictability. This talk will also briefly introduce other research in
learning-enabled energy system modeling and optimization. At last, this talk
will briefly describe future research plan and services beyond research in
this field.
