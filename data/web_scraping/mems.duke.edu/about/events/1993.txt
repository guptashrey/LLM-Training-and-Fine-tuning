## Presenter

Dr. Ellen M. Arruda

The Anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, of the knee is a soft tissue structure
comprised of two main bundles of hierarchical collagenous structures. As with
all soft tissue, the ACL is extremely difficult to mechanically test, and
determining its non-linear, anisotropic mechanical response has remained
elusive. Yet, obtaining the mechanical properties of the ACL is exceedingly
clinically relevant to the design of better replacement grafts for torn ACLs
or to prevent ACL tears in the first place. This talk will focus on our recent
efforts to characterize the ACL response utilizing full-field displacement
measurement techniques that offer more accurate, repeatable, and comprehensive
experimental data than traditional testing methods. We've pioneered full-
volume characterization techniques that provide much needed insight into the
inaccuracies associated with many current experimental protocols and also the
shortcomings of some popular constitutive models in capturing the full 3D
response of the ACL. I will describe how we use these data to develop an ACL
constitutive model for implementation into computational models of the knee
during regular gait and under impact loading simulations. Accurate
computational models of the knee such as ours may one day be used to guide
clinical practice to intervene to prevent an ACL injury or to determine the
best course of action to repair an injury.
