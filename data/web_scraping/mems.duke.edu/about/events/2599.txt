## Presenter

Daniel Floryan

What makes science beautiful? It is its ability to reveal patterns,
regularity, and make connections between things that don't seem connected. We
consider three examples centered about fluid mechanics that display complex
behavior, and peer behind the curtain to reveal hidden simplifying patterns.
First, we consider what makes a variety of dolphins, sharks, bony fish, birds,
bats, and insects all the same. Second, we introduce work that suggests the
existence of universal structures in turbulence. Third, we discuss recent
efforts to automate the process of discovery to some degree. We end with a
discussion of connecting themes.
