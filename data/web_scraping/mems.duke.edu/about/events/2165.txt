TALK ABSTRACT:  
Liquid-liquid phase separation in biological membranes is usually described as
occurring on sub-micron length scales. A stunning counterexample occurs in S.
cerevisiae - the same yeast used to brew beer and make bread. When these yeast
sense that they have run out of glucose to eat, coexisting liquid phases
appear within the lipid membrane that surrounds one of their organelles. This
phase separation is functionally important, enabling yeast survival during
periods of stress. This talk will review recent results showing: (1) This
miscibility transition is reversible as would be expected from equilibrium
thermodynamics, even though it occurs in a living system. (2) Yeast actively
regulate this phase transition to hold the membrane transition ~15C above the
yeast growth temperature. (3) In cases when domains appear as stripes, there
is no current theory that explains all material properties and physical
observables of the system. No previous knowledge of biology is needed for this
seminar
