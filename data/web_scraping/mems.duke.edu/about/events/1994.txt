## Presenter

Dr. Hod Lipson | Columbia University

Can machines discover scientific laws automatically? Despite the prevalence of
big data, the process of distilling data into scientific laws has resisted
automation. Particularly challenging are situations with small amounts of data
that is difficult or expensive to collect. This talk will outline a series of
recent research projects, starting with self-reflecting robotic systems, and
ending with machines that can formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and
interpret the results, to discover new scientific laws. We will see examples
from psychology to cosmology, from classical physics to modern physics, from
big science to small science.

Hod Lipson is a professor of Engineering at Columbia University in New York,
and a co-author of the award winning book "Fabricated: The New World of 3D
printing", and "Driverless: Intelligent cars and the road ahead". His work on
self-aware and self-replicating robots challenges conventional views of
robotics, and his TED talk on self-aware machines is one of the most viewed
presentations on AI. Lipson directs the Creative Machines Lab, which pioneers
new ways to make machines that create, and machines that are creative. For
more information visit http://hodlipson.com.

A reception will immediately follow the seminar.

Visitor parking available in the Bryan Center Garage (Parking Garage IV).

Hosted by Dr. Wilkins Aquino
