paradigm shift to data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to
developing novel materials with desired physical properties not found in
nature.

Our students are:

  * Fluent in both AI/machine learning and materials physics
  * Creating algorithms to design novel materials
  * Leaders at the cutting edge of the new materials revolution

_A part of the NSF-sponsored aIM-NRT traineeship program, which is led by Duke
MEMS_.
