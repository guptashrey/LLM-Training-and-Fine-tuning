Enhance Your Degree with a Focus on Aerospace Research and Technology

Students in Duke Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science master's and PhD
programs can expand their learning experience through the **Studies and
Opportunities in Aerospace Research** ( _ **SOAR)**_ **Aerospace Graduate
Certificate**.

In our research groups and courses we educate future leaders in engineering to
enable the development of high performance and ultra-efficient aircraft,
including drones and UAVs. Reduced emissions, noise and vibration are also
important goals for our team.

The globally recognized faculty within the SOAR certificate program are
experts in structures and dynamics, aerodynamics, acoustics, and mathematical
and computational methods.

> "I chose Duke because its aeroelasticity faculty are some of the most
> renowned in this field in the world."
