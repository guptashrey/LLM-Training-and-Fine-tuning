Professor of the Practice in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical
Engineering and Materials Science

Professor Franzoni's research areas include: acoustics, and structural
dynamics and vibration. Practical applications of this work include: acoustics
of enclosures (rooms or vehicle interiors) and underwater acoustics (acoustic
radiation and scattering from submarines).

Professor Franzoni's interior noise research has focused on developing
improved methods for predicting sound pressure levels in acoustic spaces which
contain high-frequency sound waves with moderate damping. For these types of
sound fields, accurate prediction methods currently require extensive
computational effort. Professor Franzoni's research goal is to develop
computationally efficient methods that provide the acoustician with a fairly
detailed description of the sound field.

Professor Franzoni's work in underwater acoustics has focused on applying
Bliss' method of Analytical/Numerical Matching (ANM) to the prediction of
acoustic radiation and scattering from flexible elastic submerged structures
with discontinuities. Work is underway to implement this method in existing
Navy computer codes. A recent extension of this work is a novel method for the
homogenization of structures using a local/global decomposition method. The
result is a reduction in computational effort for certain types of problems.
