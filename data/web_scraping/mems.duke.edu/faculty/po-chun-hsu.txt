Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical
Engineering and Materials Science

Po-Chun Hsu’s research group aims to develop innovative materials for light
and heat management. With the application and desired functions in mind, we
design, synthesize, and fabricate the materials and devices with ideal
photonic structure, chemical properties, or heat transfer characteristics.
Focus areas include smart textiles, photonic fibers, solar desalination, and
solid-state cooling.

He received his Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from
Stanford University in 2016 and B.S. also in Materials Science and Engineering
from National Tsing Hua University in 2007. His PhD works involve radiative
heating/cooling textiles, electrochromic devices, nanofiber electrospinning,
and metal nanowire transparent electrodes. During 2016-2018, he was a
postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University,
focusing on electrocaloric cooling and thermal properties study of van der
Waals heterostructure materials. Having the training in both materials science
and heat transfer and participated in a wide range of projects, Dr. Hsu
embraces interdisciplinary, multiscale, and solution-oriented research that
can benefit humanity.
