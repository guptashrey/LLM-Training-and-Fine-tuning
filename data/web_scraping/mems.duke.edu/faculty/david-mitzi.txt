Simon Family Distinguished Professor

David Mitzi received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Engineering
Physics from Princeton University in 1985 and his Ph.D. in Applied Physics
from Stanford University in 1990. Prior to joining the faculty at Duke in
2014, Dr. Mitzi spent 23 years at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center, where his
focus was on the search for and application of new electronic materials,
including organic-inorganic perovskites and inorganic materials for
photovoltaic, LED, transistor and memory applications. For his final five
years at IBM, he served as manager for the Photovoltaic Science and Technology
Department, where he initiated and managed a multi-company program to develop
a low-cost, high-throughput approach to deposit thin-film chalcogenide-based
absorber layers for high-efficiency solar cells. Dr. Mitzi’s current research
interests involve making emerging photovoltaic materials more effective, cost-
efficient and competitive for the energy market. He holds a number of patents,
and has authored or coauthored more than 200 papers and book chapters.
