J.A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering

Professor Bejan was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal 2018 and the Humboldt
Research Award 2019. His research covers engineering science and applied
physics: thermodynamics, heat transfer, convection, design, and evolution in
nature.  
  
He is ranked among the top 0.01% of the most cited and impactful world
scientists (and top 10 in Engineering world wide) in the 2019 citations impact
database created by Stanford University’s John Ioannidis, in PLoS Biology. He
is the author of 30 books and 700 peer-referred articles. His h-index is 108
with 87,000 citations on Google Scholar. He received 18 honorary doctorates
from universities in 11 countries.
