Associate Research Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Cameron R. 'Dale' Bass is an Associate Research Professor with Duke's
Department of Biomedical Engineering and Director of the Injury and Othopaedic
Biomechanics Laboratory.  

A major research focus of Dr. Bass is the study of blast-related brain injury
and injury mechanisms. Past research has concentrated air containing organs,
such as the lungs and bowel. Results from the limited evidence of over 80
years of experimentation suggested that the brain tolerance for blast was much
greater than the pulmonary tolerance for blast. However, recent anecdotal
evidence suggests that many soldiers returning from combat have symptoms that
are consistent with underlying brain injuries. The etiology for these injuries
is unclear and may include a spectrum of sources from blunt impact injuries to
post traumatic stress disorder to primary blast injuries.  

The primary goals of this research are to:

  * determine injury thresholds for blast brain injury
  * identify injury mechanisms underlying blast brain injury

This research may help reduce the frequency of brain injury caused by blast
events, help identify treatments for such injury, and provide the knowledge to
develop better protective equipment to protect against such injuries. Many
projects involve multi-disciplinary collaborations between BME, Duke
University Medical Center, Durham Veterans Affairs, and other major research
institutions.
