Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science

Professor Tan is conducting fundamental research in materials science and
processes related to electronic materials. He and his colleagues have
originated the study of the subject of intrinsic gettering which is now widely
used to improve yield in integrated circuit fabrications using Czochralski
silicon. Primarily because of this work, the semiconductor industry granted
him the SEMMY Award in the materials category in 1987. SEMMY is one of the
highest awards the industry gives.

He has also studied the basic aspects of the following topics in silicon:
precipitation, kinetic process of defect evolution, impurity diffusion
mechanisms and point defects. These studies have led to greater understanding
of the structure and properties of defects in silicon. Since 1986, his
research interests have also included III-V compound semiconducting materials.
He is a recipient of the 1994 Alexander Von Humboldt Prize.
