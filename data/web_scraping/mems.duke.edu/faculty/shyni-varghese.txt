Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering & Materials
Science and Orthopaedics

Shyni Varghese has a triple appointment in the Duke departments of Biomedical
Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, and Orthopaedic
Surgery. She is the first MEDx Investigator.

A leader in the field of biomaterials and stem cells, Varghese will develop
her research at Duke in three major areas:

  * Musculoskeletal tissue repair
  * Disease biophysics, and
  * Organ-on-a-chip technology

  
A new initiative of the Pratt School of Engineering and Duke School of
Medicine, Duke MEDx seeks to enhance and form new collaborations between
doctors and engineers.
