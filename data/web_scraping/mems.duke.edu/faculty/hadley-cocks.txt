Professor Emeritus in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and
Materials Science

Professor Cocks' recent research has ranged over a wide variety of areas in
materials science, including crystal growth, mechanical properties of kidney
stones, lunar science, diffraction optics, materials for radiation detection,
and radiation shielding. For many years he was a consultant to Los Alamos
National Laboratories. His current interests include magnesium alloy
development and the the development of an ultrasensitive neutron detector,
which is being supported by the Department of Homeland Security. His research
has been supported by NSF, NIH, AFOSR, DOE, NREL (formerly the Solar Energy
Research Institute) as well as DHS, the American Cancer Society, and the North
Carolina Space Grand Consortium. Professor Cocks' recent book, Energy Demand
and Climate Change: Issues and Resolutions, is a popular, scientifically sound
yet easily read book providing the science and background necessary to
understand today's energy and climate problems, and offers possible answers
using both current and future technology.
