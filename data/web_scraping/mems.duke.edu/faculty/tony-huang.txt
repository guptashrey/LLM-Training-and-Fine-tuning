William Bevan Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science

Tony Jun Huang received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2005. His
research interests are in the fields of acoustofluidics, optofluidics, and
micro/nano systems for biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics. He has
authored/co-authored over 270 peer-reviewed journal publications in these
fields. His journal articles have been cited more than 27,000 times, as
documented at Google Scholar (h-index: 87).He also has 26 issued or pending
US/international patents.

Prof. Huang was elected a fellow (member) of the National Academy of Inventors
(USA) and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was also a fellow of
the following six professional societies: the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), the American Institute for Medical and
Biological Engineering (AIMBE), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the
Institute of Physics (UK), and the Royal Society of Chemistry (UK).

Huang's research has gained international recognition through numerous
prestigious awards and honors including a 2010 National Institutes of Health
(NIH) Director's New Innovator Award, a 2011 JALA Top Ten Breakthroughs of the
Year Award, a 2012 Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award from the
Society for Manufacturing Engineering, a 2013 Faculty Scholar Medal from The
Pennsylvania State University, a 2013 American Asthma Foundation (AAF) Scholar
Award, the 2014 IEEE Sensors Council Technical Achievement Award from the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the 2017 Analytical
Chemistry Young Innovator Award from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the
2019 Van C. Mow Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
(ASME), and the 2019 Technical Achievement Award from the IEEE Engineering in
Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS).
