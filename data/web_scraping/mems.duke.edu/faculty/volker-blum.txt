Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science

Volker Blum heads the "Ab initio materials simulations" group at Duke
University. Dr. Blum's research focuses on "first-principles" computational
materials science: using the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to predict
the properties of real materials from the atomic scale on upwards.  
  
Specific focus areas are interface and nanoscale systems with electronic and
energy applications, as well as work on molecular structure and spectroscopy.
Recent research topics include structure and properties of graphene on the
semiconducting substrate, SiC; structure and electronic properties of new
materials for photovoltaics; organic-inorganic hybrid materials; carbon-
nitride materials for photocatalysis; and more.  
  
Dr. Blum is the coordinator of a major computer package for computational
materials and molecular science based on electronic structure theory, FHI-
aims. Work in his group is interdisciplinary (touching areas of physics and
chemistry in addition to materials science), with opportunities for
international collaboration and exchange. Active collaborations include groups
in Berlin, Munich, London, Hefei, and elsewhere.

## Appointments and Affiliations

  * Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and
    Materials Science
  * Faculty Network Member of The Energy Initiative

## Contact Information

## Education

  * Ph.D. Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (Germany), 2001

## Research Interests

Computational predictions and understanding of new materials related to energy
and electronics, as well as molecular structure and spectroscopies, based on
the "first principles" of quantum mechanics. Much of this work is directly
connected to ongoing developments of new algorithms and computational tools in
the all-electron electronic structure package "FHI-aims" and in the broader
“ELSI” infrastructure, both led by Volker Blum.
