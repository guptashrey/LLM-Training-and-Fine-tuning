Professor in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and
Materials Science

My research laboratory uses physics-based computational tools to provide
fundamental, molecular-level understanding of a diverse range of biological
and soft-material systems, with the aim of discovering new phenomena and
developing new technologies. The methods we use or develop are largely based
on statistical mechanics, molecular modeling and simulations, stochastic
dynamics, coarse-graining, bioinformatics, machine learning, and
polymer/colloidal physics. Our current research interests fall within four
main themes: genome organization and regulation; polymer-nanoparticle
composites; viral-DNA-packaging; and DNA nanotechnology. Please visit our
website for more details about each of these research projects.
