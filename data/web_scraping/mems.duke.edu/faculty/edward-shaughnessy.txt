Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science

Professor Shaughnessy's research interests include analytical, experimental,
and computational studies of flow problems arising in biology, medicine, and
biotechnology as well as in more traditional mechanical engineering
applications.

Current research efforts include the effect of flow of non-Newtonian fluid
properties on the flow separation near a tee junction representing a model of
blood flow near a coronary artery graft; heat and momentum transfer near rough
surfaces modeled by fractal distributions of surface roughness; the influence
of flow on particle trajectories in electrostatic precipitators, inertial
separators and aerosol sampling devices; and flow processes within or near
deformable boundaries. The above work employs finite element based
computational fluid dynamics using steady and transient simulations of 2-D and
3-D flow.
