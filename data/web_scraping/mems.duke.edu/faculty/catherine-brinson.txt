## Research Interests

Mechanics of materials, with emphasis on complex hierarchical materials and
polymer based systems, and merging concepts of data science into materials.
Nanoscale and bulk scale experimental characterization, modeling and
simulation of the behavior of materials, including physics based and machine
learning approaches. Her lab’s research objective is to characterize and model
advanced materials systems, bridging across scales, to develop new
understanding of material mechanisms and transfer knowledge into FAIR datasets
towards novel material design.
