Professor with Tenure in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering
and Materials Science

Professor Howle's research interests span the disciplines of thermal science,
fluid dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics. His present research projects -
visualization of convective fluid patterns, stabilization of the no-motion
state in free convection and bifurcation in imperfect or distributed parameter
systems - are split evenly between experimental and computational methods.

A key problem facing researchers studying convection in fluid-saturated porous
media is the lack of a general, non-invasive method for pattern visualization
and wave number measurement. Professor Howle designed innovative porous media
which allow optical techniques to be used for the first time as a pattern
visualization tool in the study of porous media convection.

Computational spectral methods are efficient methods of simulation of small
aspect ratio convection systems. For large problems, these methods can become
too expensive to be practical. Professor Howle developed a reduced Galerkin
method which decreases the execution time by orders of magnitude for large
problems. This extends the range of problems for which certain spectral
methods may be used. He is currently studying porous free convection in
systems with distributed properties and binary convection using the reduced
Galerkin method.
