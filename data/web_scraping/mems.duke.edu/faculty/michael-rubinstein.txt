Aleksandar S. Vesic Distinguished Professor

The research of the Rubinstein group is in the field of polymer theory and
computer simulations. The unique properties of polymeric systems are due to
the size, topology and interactions of the molecules they are made of. Our
goal is to understand the properties of various polymeric systems and to
design new systems with even more interesting and useful properties.

Our approach is based upon building and solving simple molecular models of
different polymeric systems. The models we develop are simple enough to be
solved either analytically or numerically, but contain the main features
leading to unique properties of real polymers. Computer simulations of our
models serve as an important bridge between analytical calculations and
experiments.
