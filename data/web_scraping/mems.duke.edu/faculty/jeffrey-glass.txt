Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Jeffrey T. Glass is a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Director of the Institute for Enterprise Engineering. He holds
the Hogg Family endowed chair in Engineering Management and Entrepreneurship.
Formerly, he was the Co-Director of The Institute for the Integration of
Management and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and held
the Joseph F. Toot, Jr. endowed chair in the Case School of Engineering. Prior
to these university appointments he was the Vice President of R&D for Kobe
Steel USA Inc. Jeff received his Bachelors and Masters degrees from Johns
Hopkins University, and a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from the
University of Virginia. He also received an MBA from Duke University's Global
Executive (GEMBA) program.  
  
His current research involves electronic materials and the associated
devices/instruments improved by these materials. In particular, miniature mass
spectrometer development and engineered systems for waste treatment are
systems of focus for his lab. He is also involved in the development of joint
educational, research and technology transfer activities related to the
intersection of business and technology. He consults and holds advisory board
appointments with various companies in materials-related areas and has served
as an expert witness in patent litigation. Prior to his appointment at CWRU,
he was the Vice President of R&D for Kobe Steel USA Inc. with a focus on
electronic materials. Prior to joining Kobe Steel, he was a tenured faculty
member in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at North
Carolina State University. He has been involved in the study of Innovation
Management in technology-based organizations with a focus on the early stages
of technical development and received the 2004 Industrial Research Institute’s
Maurice Holland Award for his paper entitled “Managing the Ties Between
Central R&D and Business Units.”  
  
Jeff's technical research has focused on the growth and characterization of
thin films for electronics, including carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphenated
carbon nanotubes, diamond, silicon carbide and chalcogenides. Chemical vapor
deposition, sputtering, materials analysis and electronic/electrochemical
properties are his areas of interest. Miniature mass spectrometers,
decentralized waste treatment, smart toilets and photoelectrochemical energy
conversion devices are some of the applications his lab focuses on. He has
published over 175 papers and book chapters, edited seven books and is a co-
inventor on 14 patents. He has been a short course instructor for several
professional societies and companies and has organized numerous conferences.
He has given over 75 invited presentations in 12 different countries. He
served as a member of a Presidential Science Advisor's committee for the
assessment of diamond technology in Japan and has received two teaching awards
and the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator award. He
has held adjunct faculty appointments at North Carolina State University, Case
Western Reserve University and the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the
University of North Carolina where he has taught executive courses on Managing
Innovation.
