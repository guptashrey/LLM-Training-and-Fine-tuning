Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Manolis Veveakis earned a Ph.D. in 2010 from the Department of Mechanics of
the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. Before joining Duke
University, he was a Senior Lecturer at UNSW's School of Petroleum Engineering
since 2014 and a Research Scientist in CSIRO's Division of Earth Sciences and
Resource Engineering before that. Veveakis holds a Diploma (BSc+MEng) in
Applied Mathematics and Physics (MEng in Materials Engineering), an MSc in
Applied Mechanics and a PhD in Geomechanics.
