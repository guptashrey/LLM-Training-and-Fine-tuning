Professor in the Department of Mathematics

My primary area of expertise is the solution of nonlinear ordinary and partial
differential equations for models of physical systems. Using asymptotics along
with a mixture of other applied mathematical techniques in analysis and
scientific computing I study a broad range of applications in engineering and
applied science. Focuses of my work include problems in viscous fluid flow,
dynamical systems, and industrial applications. Approaches for mathematical
modelling to formulate reduced systems of mathematical equations corresponding
to the physical problems is another significant component of my work.
