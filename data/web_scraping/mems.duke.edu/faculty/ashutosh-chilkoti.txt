Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Ashutosh Chilkoti is the Alan L. Kaganov Professor of Biomedical Engineering
and Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University.

My research in biomolecular engineering and biointerface science focuses on
the development of new molecular tools and technologies that borrow from
molecular biology, protein engineering, polymer chemistry and surface science
that we then exploit for the development of applications that span the range
from bioseparations, plasmonic biosensors, low-cost clinical diagnostics, and
drug delivery.
