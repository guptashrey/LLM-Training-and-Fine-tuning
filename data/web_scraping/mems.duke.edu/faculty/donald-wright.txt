Associate Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Professor Wright is experienced in the application of artificial intelligence
methods for the analysis of failed mechanical elements. After completion of
two demonstration systems (FAXS I and FAXS II), a full-scale system (FALCON)
has been implemented. The expert system produces as a final product a
technical report which includes a diagnosis of both the mechanism of the
fracture and the cause of failure. Categorization with Bayesian probabilities
has proven more efficient than the commonly employed production rule approach.
Additionally, the report includes a list of past case studies most similar to
the current study.

A number of extensions to FALCON are now anticipated. The ability of the
system to compare and to quantify the similarity between case studies has led
us to believe that a method of learning without direct contact with experts is
feasible. Further, adding the task of recommending design changes will require
significant program development. In brief, the research brings together the
disciplines of materials science, mechanical design and artificial
intelligence.
