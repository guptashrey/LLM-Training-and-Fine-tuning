Professor of Chemistry

In the Wiley Group, we make new nanomaterials by controlling the assembly of
atoms in solution, and explore applications for nanomaterials in medicine,
catalysis, plasmonics, and electronics. Our goal is to precisely control the
size, shape, and composition of materials on the nanometer scale to explore
how these parameters affect the fundamental properties of a material, and
produce such nanomaterials economically so they can be applied to solve real-
world problems.
