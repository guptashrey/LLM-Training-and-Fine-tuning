# AI for Product Innovation Courses

Our novel curriculum gives students the skill set they need to build
innovative AI-based products and systems

## Pre-Program Preparation

### AIPI 503: Python Programming Boot Camp

The four-week online boot camp is designed to help students build proficiency
in the use of Python for Data Science. It covers foundational concepts and
also provides hands-on experience with critical skills including loading,
cleaning, manipulating, visualizing, analyzing and interpreting data. Upon
completion of this course, students will be in a position to use their skills
to identify, formulate and solve some practical data analysis problems.

The first two modules will provide an introduction to basic Python. From
there, the class will focus on building proficiency with three critical for
Data Science Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib). The final module
will focus on a review of probability and statistics with an emphasis on
simulation of chance experiments. Topics for this last module will include
discrete distributions, continuous density functions, combinatorics,
conditional probabilities and a final review of important densities and
functions.

Students who are proficient in Python as well as the data science libraries
covered will have the option to test out of the bootcamp.

## Technical Core

### AIPI 510: Sourcing Data for Analytics

In industry, one of the main activities, and challenges, of implementing
machine learning applications are collecting data to use in modeling. This
course introduces students to methods and tools used for data collection,
storage, manipulation, analysis and visualization. The first segment of the
course will be an introduction to numerical programming focused on building
skills in working with data via the Numpy and Pandas libraries, two of the
most common tools used by teams working with data and modeling. Technical
aspects covered will include the types of data, methods of sourcing data via
the web, APIs, and from domain-specific sensors and hardware (IoT devices), an
increasingly common source of analytics data in technical industries. The
course also introduces methods and tools for evaluating the quality of data,
performing basic exploratory data analysis, and pre-processing data for use in
analytics. Non-technical aspects covered include an introduction to data
privacy, GDPR, regulatory issues, bias, and industry-specific concerns
regarding data usage.

### AIPI 520: Modeling Process & Algorithms

This course is an introduction to the modeling process and best practices in
model creation, interpretation, validation, and selection of models for
different uses. The primary machine learning algorithms, both supervised and
unsupervised, are introduced and students become familiar with both the
mathematical theory and the programming application of the models. The primary
focus is on statistical learning approaches but the course also introduces
deep learning and its applications. At the end of this course, students should
have a solid understanding of the end-to-end modeling process and the
different types of model algorithms along with the strengths, weaknesses,
assumptions, and use cases for each type, and be capable of training and using
models in Python. Students who have taken one or more prior machine learning
courses in their undergraduate institution will have the option to take an
additional technical elective instead of AIPI 520.

### AIPI 530: Optimization in Practice

Optimization is the ultimate skill in artificial intelligence and prescriptive
analytics allowing practitioners to generate the best actionable solutions for
business needs. This class will give students required skills to
mathematically formulate relevant business problems as optimization models,
use leading software modeling syntax and solvers to generate optimum solutions
and meaningfully interpret these solutions. We will use both SAS/Optmodel and
Python/Pyomo to give student experience with proprietary and open-source
optimization software. Focus will be on problem formulation and results
interpretation.

### EGRMGMT 590-01: Software, Solution & Enterprise Architecture

Students learn the concepts and principles about how a software system is
constructed at the highest level. Software architecture is the fundamental
design of the entire system. It defines what elements are included in the
system, what function each element has, and how each element relates to one
another. In short, it is the big picture or overall structure of the whole
system, how the enterprise technology system works together. Having a clear
design of the overall system as a starting point helps to provide a solid
basis for developers to follow and it allows higher productivity and software
quality. Students immerse themselves into architecture understanding from
multiple perspectives through various UML diagrams including different
software architectures frameworks, when and how they are used, their
advantages and disadvantages. Software architecture is tied to many practical
business concerns. These include the skills and organization of the software
engineering team, the needs of the business, the development cycle, and the
intent of the software itself.

### EGRMGMT 590-03: Software Business Management

In today’s world software is pervasive in most if not all companies. A
software business is a commercial activity aimed at producing, buying, and
selling software products or services. Well-run software companies are known
for their high profit margins. This course will focus on understanding the key
success factors for software organizations to drive their portfolio strategy
by mapping out monetization models, pricing, vendor management, professional
services, development & continuous delivery, road mapping & maintenance.
