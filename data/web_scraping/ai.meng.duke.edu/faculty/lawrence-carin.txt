# Lawrence Carin

Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Lawrence Carin earned the BS, MS, and PhD degrees in electrical engineering at
the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1985, 1986, and 1989,
respectively. In 1989 he joined the Electrical Engineering Department at
Polytechnic University (Brooklyn) as an Assistant Professor, and became an
Associate Professor there in 1994. In September 1995 he joined the Electrical
and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at Duke University, where he is now
a Professor. He was ECE Department Chair from 2011-2014, the Vice Provost for
Research from 2014-2019, and since 2019 he has served as Duke's Vice President
for Research. From 2003-2014 he held the William H. Younger Distinguished
Professorship, and since 2018 he has held the James L. Meriam Distinguished
Professorship. Dr. Carin's research focuses on machine learning (ML),
artificial intelligence (AI) and applied statistics. He publishes widely in
the main ML/AI conferences, and he has also engaged in translation of research
to practice. He was co-founder of the small business Signal Innovations Group,
which was acquired by BAE Systems in 2014, and in 2017 he co-founded the
company Infinia ML. He is an IEEE Fellow.
