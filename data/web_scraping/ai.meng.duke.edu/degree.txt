# Artificial Intelligence for Product Innovation Master of Engineering

Our program is recognized as one of the top applied AI/ML graduate programs in
the world

Students in our MEng AI for Product Innovation program develop strong
technical skills in AI and machine learning together with an understanding of
how to design and build AI-powered software products.

Graduates go on to work in leading companies solving difficult problems across
many industries, such as tech, health care, energy, retail, transportation,
and finance—or pursue their own entrepreneurial ventures.

Learn to:

  * Design and develop machine learning systems for scale, security and
    usability
  * Apply traditional machine learning and deep learning models to solve
    challenging problems across domains
  * Build full-stack software applications integrating machine learning models
    utilizing the latest methods and technologies
  * Design and deploy software applications in production

Our students come from a variety of engineering and science backgrounds.

## Industry-connected Curriculum

This degree's core curriculum was developed in collaboration with the
industry.

  * **Build a personal portfolio** of real-world, hands-on AI and machine
    learning projects
  * **Receive individual advising** , academic and career, from outstanding,
    world-class faculty
  * **Be engaged with peers** from around the world as part of a small,
    intimate & immersive cohort

We prepare graduates who are ready to solve problems on the job, starting on
Day 1.

Our curriculum covers both the theory and application of AI and machine
learning, with a heavy emphasis on hands-on learning via real-world problems
and projects in each course.

Students also have two opportunities to work directly with industry leaders
during the program: through the semester-long industry capstone project and
through their summer internship.

* * *

## Flexibility and Options

12 or 16 months on-campus, or 24 months online

Innovative and immersive, this master's degree can be completed in 12 or 16
months on-campus, or online part-time in just 24 months.

### 12-Month Accelerated Option

**Significantly more affordable** than a traditional master's program—in this
option, pay tuition for only two (2) full semesters plus three (3) summer
session credits.

### 16-Month Option

Pursue this degree over three (3) full semesters plus summer—allowing you time
to take additional electives and specialize. Students pursuing this path may
take a partial load or a full load of courses during their final semester.

### 4+1: BSE+Master's Option for Duke Undergrad

Duke undergraduate students can complete undergrad _and_ this master's degree
in just five (5) years.

**Scholarship opportunity:** The AIPI 4+1 scholarship covers 20 percent of the
costs. Eligibility and other conditions apply.

### MD-Master of Engineering in AI for Product Innovation Dual Degree

Medical students at Duke can complete this degree during the Third Year.

**Scholarship opportunity:** The MD-MEng AIPI scholarship covers 20 percent of
the costs. Eligibility and other conditions apply. Offered in partnership with
Duke MEDx.

## Career paths

Graduates from our program go on to work in a variety of industries depending
on their interests and backgrounds.

Some join the largest technology, engineering, and health care companies while
others have started their own startup ventures. Many students choose to pursue
one of two different roles within companies across industries: ML Engineer,
and Data Scientist.

To best prepare students for these career trajectories, the AIPI program
offers two different optional tracks, differentiated primarily through the
choice of electives. In addition, students may elect to develop their own
track by taking electives across the Pratt School of Engineering and elsewhere
within Duke.

### Machine Learning Engineering Track

Prepare for a career in designing, building and deploying ML models and
software applications

  * Sharpen your software development skills and build expertise in AI and
    machine learning
  * Build a strong foundation in the theory and programming of ML, together
    with MLOps skills
  * Learn to design, build and deploy machine learning models in production
  * Take elective courses in data engineering, cloud computing, computer
    vision, NLP, or reinforcement learning

Students who have prior background in programming or software development and
an interest in a career path as an ML Engineer are encouraged to pursue this
track.

### Data Science Track

Prepare for a career in analyzing and modeling data to solve domain-specific
problems

  * Leverage your educational or work background in a field of engineering,
    medicine or science together with new skills in data analysis and machine
    learning
  * Solve challenging problems in your field
  * Take elective courses in statistical analysis, data visualization,
    optimization, or modeling

Students who have a background in a field of engineering, medicine or science
not related to computer science, and desire to merge their domain expertise
with ML skills to pursue a career path as a Data Scientist are encouraged to
pursue this track.

### Design Your Own Track

Customize your own pathway through the strategic choice of electives from the
Pratt School of Engineering or elsewhere in Duke (with approval).

### Duke Undergrads: 4+1: BSE+Master's

The Pratt School of Engineering's 4+1: BSE+Master option allows Duke students
to earn both an undergraduate degree and a master's in just five years.
Students may choose to start the AI for Product Innovation Master of
Engineering during their undergraduate senior year.

Students who receive admission to the AIPI program through 4+1 may allocate up
to four (4) graduate courses taken in the senior year toward Master of
Engineering requirements. Participating students may take graduate-level
electives, or AIPI core courses, in the senior year. This provides greater
flexibility when scheduling the fifth year, and Duke 4+1 students are eligible
for the AIPI Duke 4+1 scholarship.

Further details may be found on the 4+1 webpage. To discuss options for
courses to be taken in the senior year toward the AI for Product Innovation
MEng, please contact degree program Director Jon Reifschneider at
jon.reifschneider@duke.edu
