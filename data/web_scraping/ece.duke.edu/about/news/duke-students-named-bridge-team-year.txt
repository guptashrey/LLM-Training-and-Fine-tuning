# Duke Students Named 'Bridge Team of the Year'

October 20, 2021

A Duke student team won Engineers in Action's "Bridge Team of the Year" in
2021

At the 2021 Engineers in Action (EIA) Bridge Builder Conference, the Duke
chapter was named “Bridge Team of the Year." The winning team is advised by
Professor of the Practice of civil and environmental engineering David Schaad.

Schaad teaches the popular “Engineering Sustainable Design and the Global
Community” course, cross-listed with public policy and environmental science,
each spring. A number of students, including those who belong to Duke
Engineers for International Development (DEID), enroll in this course and
spend the semester designing projects like bridges, clinics and water
catchment systems over the course of the semester. In the summer, some of them
travel and live abroad, working with engineers in a host community to revise
and implement their designs.

Despite being unable to travel internationally, the Duke chapter of EIA
advanced a pedestrian bridge project in Bolivia through design, cultural
relations and safety reports. The bridge was successfully implemented by
volunteers and the local community. A vehicular bridge in West Virginia
advanced in the same ways, by Duke students who interned with EIA in lieu of
traveling. That project was completed in person this summer.

Students on the winning team are:

  * Luna Amador
  * Kaela Basmajian
  * Isabel Beariault
  * Grace Brach
  * Woodley Burrow
  * Katie Drinkwater
  * Yunyi Feng
  * Alex Fine
  * Eric Fiorenzone
  * Luis Graterol
  * Lauren Horvath
  * Cordelia Kim
  * Dea Luca
  * Matthew Lenihan
  * Ezra Melaku
  * Lucas Miller
  * Nicole Puno
  * Gopi Ramanathan
  * Ava Rimmer-Parla
  * Destin Saba
  * Charlotte Sendek
  * Spencer Schutz
  * Hana Frank Audrey Smith
  * Nikita Suri
  * Sarah Wan
  * Luke Wheeler
  * Peyton Worthington
  * Jessica Xia
