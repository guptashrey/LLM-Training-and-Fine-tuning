# Adrian Bejan Talks Constructal Law

February 23, 2015

Adrian Bejan explains how constructal law underpins the natural organization
and flow of everything in nature from rivers to evolution

Adrian Bejan, professor of materials science and mechanical engineering at
Duke University, recently sat down with film director Dan Dimancescu to
describe the nuances and uses of constructal law, which he penned in 1996. The
law states that, "For a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it
must evolve in such a way that it provides easier access to the imposed
currents that flow through it." In other words, systems that are allowed to
change will always do so in a way that increases their access to flow. Bejan
has used this concept to explain everything from the shape of a snowflake to
the evolution of modern aviation. For more information on constructal law,
visit constructal.org. To see the original story from the director, visit
http://www.kogainon.com/K/Pages/Bejan/Title.html.

**Constructal Law Explained**

Adrian Bejan explains how constructal law underpins the natural organization
and flow of everything in nature from rivers to evolution, providing a single
unifying law that can describe many processes and systems. To illustrate his
point, Bejan shows how his knowledge flows through students and readers
throughout the world.

**Behavior Transformation**

Adrian Bejan explains how understanding constructal law can influence how
scientists, engineers and many other professionals think and work.

**Constructal Law Examples**

Adrian Bejan gives a visual example of how constructal law describes a natural
system - a river.

**Constructal Law Student Impressions**

Students react to learning about the constructal law, as taught by Adrian
Bejan.
