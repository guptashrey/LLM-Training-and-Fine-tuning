# Duke Engineers Tell PBS NC Why Flush Toilets Are Wasteful—And How They Can
be Made Better

March 23, 2022

Duke research is finding ways to save water, get rid of human waste
efficiently

_Every time a toilet flushes, a gallon and a half of clean, treated water ...
literally goes down the toilet. Not efficient. That fact, and others about
theDuke Center for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Infectious Disease (WaSH-
AID), were shared in this short video produced by _Sci NC, _the PBS North
Carolina science program_ _._

## First, a Video Flush with Facts

“We use drinking water to flush our toilets,” WaSH-AID research scientist Lena
Trotochaud told PBS NC's Rossie Izlar. “And as the climate continues to change
and water becomes more scarce, and we have more droughts and more fires, we’re
going to be using more and more drinking water and having less and less of it.
We really need to conserve that precious resource.”

WaSH-AID at Duke is engineering a new kind of toilet—one that treats human
excreta onsite, with ultrafiltration processes that leave the liquid fraction
of the waste clean enough to use for flushing the toilet.

Their “Reclaimer” toilet is currently being tested at a textile mill in India,
but Trotochaud said it might someday also be a good solution, for example, in
fast-growing but dry and drought-stricken regions of the United States.

## And, No. 2, a Podcast
