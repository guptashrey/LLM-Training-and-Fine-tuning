# Sound-Induced Electric Fields Control the Tiniest Particles

June 22, 2021 | By Ken Kingery

Acoustoelectronic tweezers gently manipulate biological nanoparticles just a
few nanometers wide

Engineers at Duke University have devised a system for manipulating particles
approaching the miniscule 2.5 nanometer diameter of DNA using sound-induced
electric fields. Dubbed “acoustoelectronic nanotweezers,” the approach
provides a label-free, dynamically controllable method of moving and trapping
nanoparticles over a large area. The technology holds promise for applications
in the fields ranging from condensed matter physics to biomedicine.

The research appears online on June 22 in Nature Communications.

Precisely controlling nanoparticles is a crucial ability for many emerging
technologies. For example, separating exosomes and other tiny biological
molecules from blood could lead to new types of diagnostic tests for the early
detection of tumors and neurodegenerative diseases. Placing engineered
nanoparticles in a specific pattern before fixing them in place can help
create new types of materials with highly tunable properties.

For more than a decade, Tony Jun Huang, the William Bevan Distinguished
Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke, has pursued
acoustic tweezer systems that use sound waves to manipulate particles.
However, it becomes difficult to push things around with sound when their
profile drops below that of some of the smallest viruses.

“Although we’re still fundamentally using sound, our acoustoelectronic
nanotweezers use a very different mechanism than these previous technologies,”
said Joseph Rufo, a graduate student working in Huang’s laboratory. “Now we’re
not only exploiting acoustic waves, but electric fields with the properties of
acoustic waves.”

Instead of using sound waves to directly move the nanoparticles, Huang, Rufo
and Peiran Zhang, a postdoc in Huang’s laboratory, use sound waves to create
electric fields that provide the push. The new acoustoelectronic tweezer
approach works by placing a piezoelectric substrate—a thin material that
creates electricity in response to mechanical stress—beneath a small chamber
filled with liquid. Four transducers are aligned on the chamber’s sides, which
send sound waves into the piezoelectric substrate.

> “Our next goal is to improve the resolution of acoustoelectronic
> nanotweezers to the level of a single molecule level while scaling up the
> working area to a meter. With those improvements, we would be able to
> achieve macroscale materials and devices with precisely positioned
> nanostructures and unprecedented properties. We believe that our technology
> will be useful in many important areas including nanomedicine,
> nanoelectronics, self-assembly and wearable electronics.”

These sound waves bounce around and interact with one another to create a
stable pattern. And because the sound waves are creating stresses within the
piezoelectric substrate, they also create electrical fields. These couple with
the acoustic waves in a way that creates electric field patterns within the
chamber above.

“The vibrations of the sound waves also make the electric field dynamically
alternate between positive and negative charges,” said Zhang. “This
alternating electric field polarizes the nanoparticles in liquid, which serves
as a handle to manipulate them.”

The result is a mechanism that mixes some of the strengths of other
nanoparticle manipulators. Because the acoustoelectronic nanotweezers induce
an electromagnetic response in the nanomaterials, the nanoparticles do not
need to be conductive on their own or tagged with any sort of modifier. And
because the patterns are created with sound waves, their positions and
properties can be quickly and easily modified to create a variety of options.

In the prototype, the researchers show nanoparticles placed into striped and
checkerboard patterns. They even push individual particles around in an
arbitrary manner dynamically, spelling out letters such as D, U, K and E. The
researchers then demonstrate that these aligned nano-patterns can be
transferred onto dry films using delicate nanoparticles such as carbon
nanotubes, 3.5-nanometer proteins and 1.4-nanometer dextran often used in
biomedical research. And they show that all of this can be accomplished on a
working area that is tens to hundreds of times larger than current state-of-
the-art nanotweezing technologies.

This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01GM132603,
R01GM135486, UG3TR002978, R33CA223908, R01GM127714), the United States Army
Medical Research Acquisition Activity (W81XWH-18-1-0242), and the National
Science Foundation (ECCS-1807601).
