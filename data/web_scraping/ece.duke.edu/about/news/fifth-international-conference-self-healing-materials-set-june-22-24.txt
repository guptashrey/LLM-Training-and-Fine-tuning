# Fifth International Conference on Self-Healing Materials Set for June 22-24

June 18, 2015

For only the second time, the International Conference on Self-Healing
Materials will be held in the United States

If you think concrete that can repair its own cracks is pretty cool or the
fact that electrically active artificial skin that can heal itself actually
exists is pretty awesome, Durham has just the event for you.

For only the second time, the International Conference on Self-Healing
Materials will be held in the United States. Self-healing materials is a young
field focused on developing new materials that can automatically repair
themselves without any change in their environment or help from the outside
world. Industries with ongoing self-healing materials research programs
include aerospace, automotive, transportation, microelectronics, architecture,
electronics, the military and manufacturing.

Co-sponsored by Duke University, the University of North Carolina – Chapel
Hill and North Carolina State University, the conference takes place June
22-24, 2015, at the Durham Convention Center in downtown Durham, NC.
Conference organizers expect to attract more than 300 participants, with more
than three-quarters traveling internationally to Durham.

To learn more, visit the conference website.
