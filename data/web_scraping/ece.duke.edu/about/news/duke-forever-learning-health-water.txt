# Duke Forever Learning: The Health of Water

April 11, 2022

Duke's Forever Learning Institute hosted Duke experts who are discovering new
and better ways to assess and safeguard water resources

Water quality has enormous impacts on human health and environmental systems.
Identifying and tracking contaminants in our increasingly scarce water supply
is a complex and difficult task—one that Duke researchers are attacking on
multiple fronts.

Duke researchers from across the university contributed to a special video
session about water quality, which was hosted by the Forever Learning
Institute. Experts from Duke's Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of
the Environment and Trinity College of Arts & Sciences discussed challenges
and their discoveries related to identifying pollutants, assessing their
impact, and developing new approaches to safeguarding water resources.

Watch the full session:

Avner Vengosh, Distinguished Professor of Environmental Quality, moderated
presentations by:

  * Lee Ferguson, Associate Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering:
    _"Forever chemicals," how they're regulated, and why a different approach
    to monitoring is required_
  * Emily Bernhardt, James B. Duke Distinguished Professor: _How stream
    ecosystems change in urban environments_
  * Gabriel Katul, Theodore S. Coile Distinguished Professor of Hydrology and
    Micrometeorology: _How grain production patterns may change as usable
    water becomes more scarce_
