# MEDx Announces 2020 Pilot Project Awardess

September 24, 2020

Mark Palmeri, Ken Gall and Warren Grill received grants to pursue
collaborative projects

View the full announcement on the MEDx website

MEDx (Medicine + Engineering at Duke) recently announced their 2020 Pilot
project awardees. MEDx offers an annual call for proposals to fund early-stage
research for forming new collaborations or expanding existing collaborations
between faculty members in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering.

To be considered for this year’s Pilot Projects grant, projects had to benefit
human health by providing important disease insights or developing
technologies to aid in disease prevention, diagnosis or treatment. MEDx
received 36 applications covering a wide range of topics and spanning all
Pratt School of Engineering departments and a large number of departments and
divisions from the School of Medicine.

MEDx ultimately awarded the grants to five projects, including:

**mHealth Tympanometer: A Digital Innovation to Address Childhood Hearing Loss
in Low Resource Settings**  
Susan Emmett, M.D.| Head and Neck Surgery and Communication Sciences  
Mark Palmeri, M.D., Ph.D. | Biomedical Engineering (BME)

Childhood hearing loss has lifelong implications for speech and language
development, school achievement and future employment opportunities. Over 80%
of affected individuals reside in low- and middle-income countries or
underserved populations in high income countries, causing major barriers for
hearing care. This team will develop a novel mHealth tympanometer with a
machine learning interface to transform this technology from a device limited
to use in only high resource environments into a low-cost screening tool that
could be broadly disseminated in low resource settings.

**Computational Localization of the Epileptic Focus for Resection Surgery**  
Saurabh Sinha, M.D., Ph.D. | Neurology  
Warren Grill, Ph.D. | Biomedical Engineering (BME)

Approximately 1 million Americans with epilepsy do not benefit adequately from
medications. Surgical removal of the brain tissues where seizures originate –
the epileptogenic zone (EZ) – can completely eliminate seizures but is
entirely dependent on accurate identification of the EZ. This team will
develop and evaluate clinically-useful software tools to improve EZ
localization and hopefully improve seizure freedom rates following resection
surgery.

**The AirFLO2 Device for Treatment of Hypoxemia and/or Tachypnea in COVID-19
Patients**  
Loretta Que, M.D. | Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine  
Ken Gall, Ph.D. | Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science  
FastTrack Medical Device Translator | Duke Engineering Entrepreneurship and
NeuroInnovations

There is a growing concern regarding healthcare capacity for managing severely
ill COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome,
and a gap in non-invasive treatment options for respiratory management in
these patients. In response, this team will develop AirFLO2, a self-
administered, non-invasive positive end expiratory pressure treatment to
improve oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia. This device will prove a safe
and standardized method to treat hypoxemia. It will also reduce the urgency
and overall need for invasive ventilation, ICU transfers and/or decrease the
length of hospital stay.

outrageously ambitious
