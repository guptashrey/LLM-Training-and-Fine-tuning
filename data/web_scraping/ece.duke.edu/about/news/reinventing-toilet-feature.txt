# Reinventing the Toilet: Seeking a ‘Safe and Dignified Solution’ to the
Sanitation Crisis

November 5, 2018

Supported through multiple grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
the Center for WaSH-AID and two emerging technologies hope to reshape the
lives and health of billions of people both worldwide and at home

We all know that everyone poops. But no one should have to live with the
results.

Unfortunately, the reality today is that about a third of the world's
population – some 2.5 billion people - defecate in the open or use substandard
facilities that allow human waste to mix with water sources used for cleaning
and drinking.

The consequences are staggering. Just one, the World Health Organization
estimates, is that 525,000 children under the age of five die each year from
diarrheal illnesses linked to poor sanitation.

But with clever ideas and a lot of hard work, help is on the way. Duke is home
to two of the "Reinvent The Toilet" efforts funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation to address this massive problem. The concentration of expertise
here has also led to the development of a national Sanitation Technology
Cluster based at Duke.

Learn all about these massive and growing efforts in a new feature published
on the DukeStories platform.

outrageously ambitious
