# An App for Autism Screening

March 3, 2017

Apple ResearchKit Autism & Beyond app is being studied as a possible tool to
expand autism screening and enable earlier diagnosis and intervention

As a toddler watches videos on a new Duke-developed app, sophisticated
algorithms analyze “selfie”-camera recordings of her head movements and facial
expressions for small but significant signs of autistic behavior, such as a
lack of emotions, social-reference, or delayed response.

To date more than 2,000 people from the US to South Africa have downloaded the
Apple ResearchKit “Autism & Beyond” app, which is being studied as a possible
tool to expand autism screening and enable earlier diagnosis and intervention.
It’s a critical need given that most children with autism aren’t diagnosed
until age 5 or later.

Developed by Duke ECE’s Guillermo Sapiro, Duke Health’s Dr. Helen Egger and
Dr. Geraldine Dawson, and a team of over 20 programmers, scientists and
students in close partnership with Apple, the new research app is not a
diagnostic tool, but provides parents with information and encouragement to
seek consultation with a care provider if the data appear to indicate their
child may be at risk.

“Our goal is to develop a screening, like checking kids’ hearing or eyesight
at schools,” said Sapiro. “They don’t get glasses; they get a referral.”

After validating the app’s feasibility as a screening tool, the team is
starting large-scale clinical testing at sites in South Africa, Argentina,
Singapore and the US. They’re also using the software as a springboard to
develop similar screening tools for post-traumatic stress disorder and picky
eating.

> “If you look at the papers coming out from Duke in big-data science, in
> mobile health, you’ll see undergrads, grad students, developers, physicians,
> psychologists, social scientists and engineers all listed as contributors.
> That kind of integration is very unusual—and very Duke.”
