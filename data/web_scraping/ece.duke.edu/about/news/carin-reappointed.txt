# Larry Carin Reappointed to New Term as Vice Provost for Research

October 4, 2018

ECE Professor Larry Carin has been with the department since 1995 and was
chair from 2011-2014

Following a standard review for university administrators, Larry Carin has
been reappointed as vice provost for research for a five-year term beginning
July 1, 2019, Provost Sally Kornbluth announced today. He has held the
position for the last four years.

The faculty review committee was chaired by Ken Gall, professor of mechanical
engineering and materials science.

Carin joined the Duke faculty in 1995 as an associate professor of electrical
engineering and was appointed professor in 2001. He then became chair of the
Department of Electrical Engineering in 2011 before being named vice provost
in 2014.

The Office of the Vice Provost for Research is responsible for facilitating
the research enterprise at Duke and works to encourage and support the
development, marketing and application of Duke's intellectual property and our
researchers, students and facilities.

“Larry’s own extensive and exemplary research provided him with the experience
necessary to lead Duke’s research enterprise,” Kornbluth said. “He has
assembled an excellent team and has reached out across the university and
health system to forge collaborations, engage with faculty and people involved
in research at all levels, and work to advance Duke’s research and
contributions to society. I am delighted that he will be continuing in his
role as vice provost for research.”

Carin received a bachelor of science, master’s degree and Ph.D. in
engineering, all from the University of Maryland in College Park.

outrageously ambitious
