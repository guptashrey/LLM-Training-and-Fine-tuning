# Randles Named Finalist for Supercomputing’s Top Honor

August 27, 2015

Amanda Randles, a new assistant professor in biomedical engineering at Duke
University, has been named one of five finalists for this year’s Gordon Bell
Prize—the top honor in the field of supercomputing.

Amanda Randles, a new assistant professor in biomedical engineering at Duke
University, has been named one of five finalists for this year’s Gordon Bell
Prize—the top honor in the field of supercomputing. The $10,000 prize
recognizes innovative applications of parallel computing to challenges in
science, engineering, and large-scale data analytics, and making it to this
finalist stage is widely considered an honor in and of itself.

The paper that Randles is being recognized for is titled “Massively Parallel
Models of the Human Circulatory System.” Along with colleagues from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Randles presents a new, highly scalable
algorithm that can model the human vascular system in record time. With faster
calculations of body-wide blood flow, doctors could eventually make risk
assessments for diseases on a patient-by-patient basis.

The winner will be announced at the 2015 International Conference for High
Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis taking place on
November 15 - 20, 2015, in Austin, Texas.

outrageously ambitious
