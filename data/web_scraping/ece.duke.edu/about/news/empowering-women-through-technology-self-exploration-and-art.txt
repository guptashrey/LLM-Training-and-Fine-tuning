# Empowering Women through Technology, Self-Exploration and Art

March 8, 2019

Learn how a global art and empowerment project grew out of a medical device
designed by Duke’s Center for Global Women’s Health Technologies in this
behind-the-scenes interview with Libby Dotson (Trinity, '18), exhibition
curator.

The exhibition _(In)visible Organ_ (on view in the Ruby through March 8)
reflects the empowering experiences of women who used the Calla Campaign’s
Callascope. The team behind the exhibition aims to increase awareness of
cervical cancer globally while combating stigmas around women’s health.

“This art exhibit was an idea that Wesley Hogan, director of the Center for
Documentary Studies, and I tossed around over dinner and then subsequently put
together in the form of a proposal to the Duke Council for the Arts more than
two years ago,” said Nimmi Ramanujam, Robert W. Carr Professor of Biomedical
Engineering and director of the Center for Global Women’s Health Technologies.

“While I had an idea what I wanted this art exhibit to speak to, I could have
never envisioned what it actually turned out to be—a beautiful collection of
women’s voices told in the most authentic and expressive ways about a sacred
part of their bodies. Libby and her team achieved a monumental feat and I am
so proud of her and grateful to everyone that contributed to this mission. I
just hope we can keep the conversation going and not lose the momentum that
this exhibit has created,” Ramanujam continued.

In this interview, recent alumna Libby Dotson describes the origins of this
innovative art exhibition, her role as lead curator and her hopes of expanding
this positive, inclusive conversation on women’s health globally.
