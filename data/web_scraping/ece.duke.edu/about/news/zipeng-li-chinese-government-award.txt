# Zipeng Li Receives Chinese Government’s Outstanding Students Abroad Award

January 23, 2018

Recent ECE doctoral graduate works to improve microfluidic biochip technology

Zipeng Li, a recent doctoral graduate from the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering, has won the Chinese Government Award for Outstanding
Self-Financed Students Abroad.

Li’s research in the laboratory of Krishnendu Chakrabarty, chair and professor
of electrical and computer engineering, has focused on microfluidic biochips.
His work has helped advance the technology through breakthroughs in design
automation, optimization and testing methods for micro-electrode-dot-array
chips. Li spent time as an intern at NVIDIA in 2016 and Apple in 2017, before
graduating and accepting a position as a senior DFT engineer at Intel.

Since the award was started in 2003 by the Chinese Government, it has
recognized each year the academic achievements of non-government-funded
Chinese students studying overseas among 29 countries. The award is granted
across all fields of study and comes with a one-time financial reward of
$6,000.

The award is open to all graduate-level Chinese students studying abroad and
is based on academic excellence demonstrated through criteria such as
publications and international conference talks. Candidates are narrowed by
scholars active in the applicants’ areas and finalized by a review panel
organized by the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) of the Ministry of
Education.
