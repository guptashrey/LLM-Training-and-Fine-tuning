# Fourteen Graduate Students Earn External Fellowships

October 21, 2019

Highly competitive national awards will help 11 new and returning Duke
Engineering graduate students conduct research on campus

Each year, the Pratt School of Engineering encourages graduate students to
seek support from external fellowship awards. Earning these competitive
fellowships goes a long way toward helping emerging scientists conduct their
research while raising Duke Engineering’s profile and research portfolio in
turn.

This year, new and returning Duke Engineering graduate students nabbed 14
fellowships from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institutes of Health, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation and the Idaho National Laboratory.

“Earning each of these fellowships is a highly competitive process," said
Jennifer West, the Fitzpatrick Family University Professor of Engineering and
Associate Dean for Ph.D. Education at Duke. “It is gratifying to see the
talent and hard work of our exceptional doctoral students recognized at this
level.”
