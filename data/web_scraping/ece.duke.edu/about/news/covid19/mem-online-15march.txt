# Message to Master of Engineering Management (MEM) Online Students

_March 15, 2020_

MEM Online Students,

You have likely already heard about Duke University’s response to COVID-19.
You can find the latest information and communications from Duke University at
coronavirus.duke.edu and Duke Engineering at pratt.duke.edu/covid19.

Please make note of this guidance specifically for our MEM Online students
(note that details are subject to change given the rapidly evolving nature of
this situation):

  * First and foremost, we are concerned about your wellbeing. Please take the
    appropriate precautions to prevent COVID-19: cdc.gov

  * The goal is to limit face-to-face interactions (via social distancing) to
    minimize the potential spread of COVID-19. As a result, all Duke students
    will be fully engaged in the use of online collaborative tools and we will
    not have any in-person student events before at least May 7, 2020. **You
    should not visit the campus between now and May 7th** unless there is a
    specific business reason that cannot be managed through video-conference
    or a telephone call.

  * Duke Engineering graduate classes will resume in an online format only on
    Monday, March 23rd. The final day of graduate classes is Wednesday, April
    15th. As current online students, you will be familiar with the tools that
    your professors select to support synchronous (live) and asynchronous
    interactions. You should retain asynchronous access to all course
    components as before. Your faculty members will advise you of any changes
    to the course format, adjustments to syllabi and expectations for the
    remainder of the term.

  * Duke has developed a website for students transitioning to remote learning
    at coronavirus.duke.edu. Please make sure that you can access your Duke
    Zoom account and understand how to navigate the application:
    oit.duke.edu/help/articles/zoom-meetings-getting-started

  * Given the restrictions on campus events, Residency 3 as scheduled from May
    4th – May 8th will now be delivered virtually with live (real-time) and
    offline components. Please stand by for more information about the amended
    schedule as well as your options to complete the EGRMGMT 506 requirement.
    You can find the latest details about the Graduation in May 2020 on the
    university’s website in the interim at: commencement.duke.edu

  * As always, contact Pratt IT (john.vincent@duke.edu) or me
    (latondra.murray@duke.edu) in addition to your faculty if you encounter
    any issues with access to your EGRMGMT course content via Sakai, Panopto
    or Zoom going forward.

We appreciate your flexibility and understanding as we mutually navigate this
challenging, dynamic situation. If you have any questions or concerns, please
let us know.

Regards,

Dr. LaTondra Murray  
latondra.murray@duke.edu

outrageously ambitious
