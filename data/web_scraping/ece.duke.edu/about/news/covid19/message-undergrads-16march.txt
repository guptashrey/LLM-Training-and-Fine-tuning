# Message to Undergraduate Students from Pratt Academic Deans

_March 16, 2020_

Dear Pratt undergraduate students,

First and foremost, we hope you and your loved ones are doing well and staying
healthy during these fast-changing times. As your academic deans, we’d like to
highlight some helpful and important resources here, and make sure you have
the information you need during this transition to remote teaching for the
remainder of the semester.

Your best sources for up-to-date announcements are the following:

  * coronavirus.duke.edu _(Duke-specific information regarding any university
    announcement)_
  * coronavirus.duke.edu/category/for-students _(information specific to
    students)_
  * coronavirus.duke.edu/ _(contains_ _frequently asked questions about remote
    learning, resources available to students on- and off-campus, vacating
    campus housing, and what to expect from Duke’s curtailed services for the
    rest of the Spring 2020 term.)_
  * pratt.duke.edu/covid19 _(Information specific to the Pratt community)_

**If you have ANY concern or questions about your situation in regard to
getting home safely, and/or having the appropriate resources to resume your
coursework remotely, please let us know so we can connect you with the
appropriate university official, or you can email** **keeplearning@duke.edu
directly for assistance. **

The deans are not holding any in-person meetings during this time but we are
still here to help! We are available for phone or Zoom meetings, if you would
like to meet remotely with us.

Finally, we are working on a plan for advising and registration for your fall
semester courses that will be coming up in April. Stay tuned for that!

Sincerely,

Your Pratt School of Engineering Academic Deans
