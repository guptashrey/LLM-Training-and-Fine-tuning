# Twelve Graduate Students Earn External Fellowships in 2021

December 9, 2021

Highly competitive national awards will help 12 new and returning Duke
Engineering graduate students conduct research on campus

Each year, the Pratt School of Engineering encourages graduate students to
seek support from external fellowship awards. Earning these competitive
fellowships goes a long way toward helping emerging scientists conduct their
research while raising Duke Engineering’s profile and research portfolio in
turn.

This year, new and returning Duke Engineering graduate students nabbed 12
fellowships from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense,
the National Institutes of Health and the Thai Government.

Fellowship can usually either be activated the year in which they are awarded,
or deferred until the following year, as noted in the descriptions below.

“The selection process for these fellowships is incredibly competitive," said
Aaron Franklin, the Addy Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and
Associate Dean for PhD Education at Duke. “We commend these doctoral students
for their hard work and impressive preparation that earned them such top-notch
recognition."
