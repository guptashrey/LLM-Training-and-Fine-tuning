# Duke Engineering hosts 'Talk & Tour' for 70 Women in STEM Internship Program

June 12, 2019

Discussions included tips on applying to graduate school and obtaining
fellowships

At the summer 2019 event, 13 Duke faculty and staff members, led by Nan
Jokerst, the J. A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer
Engineering and executive director of Duke's Shared Materials Instrumentation
Facility (SMIF), showed nearly 70 interns, as well as students and visiting
scholars around SMIF.

They gave visitors much practical advice—including tips on positioning oneself
for graduate school, crafting a successful application, and applying for
fellowships.

The Talk & Tour at Duke was one of 10 held by the Triangle Women in STEM's
Summer Intern Program. All told, the program served 100 interns and included
contributions from 18 participating Research Triangle Region organizations.

Triangle Women in STEM is an initiative of science, technology and engineering
leaders with a mission to establish North Carolina’s Research Triangle Region
as the preeminent destination for women in STEM fields.
