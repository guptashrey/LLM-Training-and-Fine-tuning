on Image Processing.

Sina Farsiu, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, ophthalmology,
computer science, and electrical and computer engineering, will join eight of
his colleagues around the world as a senior area editor for IEEE Transactions
on Image Processing. The journal covers novel theory, algorithms, and
architectures for the formation, capture, processing, communication, analysis,
and display of images, video, and multidimensional signals in a wide variety
of applications.

Farsiu was an associate editor of the journal from 2010 to 2014, and his new
appointment lasts until November 2018. He is the youngest senior area editor
for the magazine, and the only one who is currently an assistant professor.

outrageously ambitious
