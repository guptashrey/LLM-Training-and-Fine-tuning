# Now on Your Smartphone: Duke Engineering’s New Podcast ‘Rate of Change’

September 10, 2019

Duke experts talk about engineering solutions for a fast-changing world

For thousands of years, engineers changed the world by moving dirt and stone
and building roads and aqueducts. They solved the problems that made it
possible to live in cities, fly across oceans and send messages around the
globe.

Today, engineers continue to take on the biggest challenges and the toughest
problems—in a world that’s changing at an unprecedented pace.

> There’s a new and entertaining way to learn more about how today’s
> engineering discoveries are poised to transform our world—Duke Engineering’s
> new podcast, “Rate of Change.”

They’re investigating solutions to climate change, to infectious disease, to
air and water pollution, and even to the lack of transparency in the criminal
justice system.

Their toolkits still include concrete and steel, but also millions of lines of
inventive computer code and amazing new materials with properties not found in
nature. And, of course, at the center of all these technological advances is
the engineer—an inspired creator, seeing a problem and designing its solution.

Now, there’s a new and entertaining way to learn more about how today’s
engineering discoveries are poised to transform our world—Duke Engineering’s
new podcast, “Rate of Change.”

The first season is available for download now at the link below, or through
Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts.

Hear conversations with Duke Engineering faculty members:

  * Mike Bergin, on what it takes to improve air quality in India
  * David Katz, on empowering women to prevent HIV transmission
  * Cynthia Rudin, on the ethics of machine learning algorithms
  * Nenad Bursac, on growing new muscle tissue from stem cells
  * Po-Chun Hsu, on how next-generation textiles could help curb emissions
