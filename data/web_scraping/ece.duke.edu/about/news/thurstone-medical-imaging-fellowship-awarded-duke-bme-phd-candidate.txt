# Thurstone Medical Imaging Fellowship Awarded to Duke BME PhD Candidate

November 13, 2013

The fellowship was endowed by Olaf von Ramm and named in honor of Fritz
Thurstone, a pioneer in the field of diagnostic imaging

Stephen Rosenzweig, a PhD candidate in Duke's Department of Biomedical
Engineering, has been awarded the first competitive Thurstone Medical Imaging
Fellowship in Biomedical Engineering.

This award provides an annual stipend supplement and educational allowance
until time of degree, or a maximum of four years. The new fellowship was
endowed by Professor Olaf von Ramm and named in honor of Professor Fritz
Thurstone, a pioneer in the field of diagnostic imaging and one of the
founding members of the Duke Department of Biomedical Engineering.

Rosenzweig is a sixth-year PhD student working under the direction of
Professor Kathy Nightingale. He is a Medical Imaging Training Grant Fellow and
a James B. Duke Graduate Fellow. Rosenzweig has published six peer-reviewed
journal articles, two book chapters, numerous conference abstracts, and a
patent. He has also performed an industrial internship, where he developed
research interface tools to enable custom beam sequencing and raw data
acquisition on a state-of-the-art cardiac ultrasound system.

outrageously ambitious
