# Letter from the Chair, 2021

October 8, 2021

Dear Colleagues,

It has been an eventful year in Duke Engineering—to begin, there was the
appointment of our new Vinik dean, Jerome Lynch, who will take the helm of the
school in early 2022. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
has had more than its share of excitement as well—our department now boasts 10
major research centers, with the establishment of multiple new endeavors this
year:

  * The NSF AI Institute for Edge Computing Leveraging Next Generation
    Networks;
  * The Air Force Research Laboratory/Air Force Office of Scientific Research
    University Center of Excellence focusing on agile waveform design for
    communication networks in contested environments;
  * A Department of Defense MURI center supporting metasurface-enabled imaging
    systems; and
  * The NSF-funded Alliance for Identity-Inclusive Computing Education
    (AIICE).

You can read more in this year's digital magazine, alongside stories
highlighting the entrepreneurial culture of Duke ECE and the myriad resources
available to students and faculty interested in translating their research
into products and services available to the public. In fact, I had the recent
thrill of being present on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when IonQ,
a Duke ECE spinoff and the world's first pure-play quantum computing company,
went public. Two of our faculty members, Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim, joined
IonQ president Peter Chapman as he rang the bell and began trading for the
day.

Whether our startups grow to fill a specialized niche or eventually expand
into multi-billion-dollar companies poised to take over entire market
segments, we are proud that each spun out from the work of our brilliant Duke
ECE community.

Enjoy!

**Krishnendu Chakrabarty**  
 _John Cocke Distinguished Professor and Chair_
