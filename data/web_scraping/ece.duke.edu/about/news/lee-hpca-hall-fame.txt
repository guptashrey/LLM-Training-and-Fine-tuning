# Benjamin Lee Inducted into HPCA Hall of Fame

March 1, 2018

Joins only 38 peers recognized as having eight or more papers appearing in one
of the premier publication venues for computer engineers

Benjamin Lee was one of seven researchers inducted into the High-Performance
Computer Architecture (HPCA) Hall of Fame this year. The distinction
recognizes the authors with eight or more papers that have appeared in the
Proceedings of the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer
Architecture, one of the premier publication venues for computer engineers.
The HPCA Hall of Fame currently includes just 39 members.

Also this year, Lee was given the Best Paper Award at the HPCA annual
conference for his paper "Amdahl’s Law in the datacenter era: A market for
fair processor allocation." In the paper, Lee and his colleagues describe how
to operationalize a classic performance model, Amdahl’s Law, to allocate
processors to users in a shared computer system. Allocations formally
guarantee sharing incentives such that users prefer the shared system over a
private one. The paper was co-authored by two PhD students, Seyed Majid Zahedi
(CS) and Qiuyun Llull (ECE).

outrageously ambitious
