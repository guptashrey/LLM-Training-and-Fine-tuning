# Gavin Named Chair of Duke CEE

November 1, 2022 | Mark Schreiner

Henri P. Gavin, an internationally regarded expert in earthquake hazard
mitigation and nonlinear dynamics, will lead Duke CEE through 2024 with a
focus on addressing the challenges brought by climate change

Henri P. Gavin has been appointed the W.H. Gardner, Jr., Chair of Duke’s
Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering. An internationally recognized
expert in earthquake hazard mitigation and respected mentor and faculty
leader, Gavin has served in an interim capacity since mid-2020 and will now
lead Duke CEE through June 2024.

“After seeing the energy and collaborative leadership he has brought to the
position on an interim basis, I concluded that Henri would be an excellent
choice to continue as the Gardner Chair of Duke CEE,” said Jerome P. Lynch,
Vinik Dean of Engineering at Duke. “Henri has developed an international
network of colleagues invested in engineering solutions to global challenges,
such as resilience to earthquakes. These purposeful relationships are just one
example of why Henri is an excellent person to lead Duke CEE during a period
in which the department, Duke Engineering and Duke University have made a bold
commitment to lead and serve society on the critical challenges posed by
emerging hazards, especially climate change.”

Gavin is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke, where he
has been a faculty member since 1995 and the interim Department Chair since
2020.

During his two years leading Duke CEE, Gavin has been deeply engaged in the
creation of new curricula that are based on the department’s areas of research
expertise and focused on creating inspired and well-equipped problem solvers
for complex societal challenges including climate change. Duke CEE, Gavin
said, seeks to be an engaged and energized community of scholars and engineers
working in service to society.

> "Through Duke CEE’s research, educational and outreach programs, we seek to
> provide leadership, expertise and training for a generation of well-equipped
> and inspired engineers who will take on the grand challenge of reducing the
> effects of climate change.”

“The disciplines of civil and environmental engineering, which had their start
in ancient times and have never stopped evolving, are in our time again poised
for significant transformation and societal impact,” Gavin said. “These areas
of engineering practice are at the center of humanity’s efforts to reduce the
effects of climate change.”

At Duke CEE, Gavin has been instrumental in developing a new interdisciplinary
undergraduate major in Risk, Data & Financial Engineering and designing a
forthcoming Master of Engineering degree program in Climate & Sustainability
Engineering.

“We are fully aligned with Duke University’s Climate Commitment,” Gavin said.
"Through Duke CEE’s research, educational and outreach programs, we seek to
provide leadership, expertise and training for a generation of well-equipped
and inspired engineers who will take on this grand challenge.”

Over the last two years, Duke CEE established the $26 million, National
Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Center for Precision Microbiome
Engineering, or PreMiEr. This ambitious research and outreach enterprise aims
to engineer microbial communities in the built environment for the benefit of
society. The multi-university center is led by Duke CEE’s Claudia Gunsch.

Also, Michael Bergin, the Sternberg Family Professor of Civil & Environmental
Engineering at Duke, launched a $3.6 million initiative in partnership with
Underwriter Laboratories to better understand links between air pollution and
human health. That project will focus in part on recent wildfires in
California.

As department chair, Gavin said he will focus on career mentoring for junior
faculty and fostering continuous and open dialogue between students, staff and
faculty to build a strong, supportive, diverse, and inclusive departmental
community.

An engaging, hands-on educator, Gavin in recent fall terms has mentored
student teams in Duke Engineering’s First-Year Design Program, where students
in the first semester of their college experience take on authentic design
challenges posed by clients in the Duke community and beyond.

Each spring, he and his students bring curious attention to Harrington
Engineering Quad, where they erect “tensegrity” structures, which stand
without any nails, screws, or other fasteners because of carefully balanced
tension and compression among lengths of nylon cord and common lumber.

Gavin and his graduate students are internationally regarded experts in
magneto-rheological material modeling, visco-elastic rolling resistance,
constrained dynamics, nonstationary wind field simulation, system
identification, structural dynamics, multi-agent robotics, and nonlinear
control.

Through his wide-ranging work on seismic hazard mitigation, he has forged
global relationships -- including with leading universities and researchers in
Japan, Nepal, and New Zealand. He holds a secondary appointment in the Thomas
Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, is a Faculty
Network member of the Duke University Energy Initiative and is a Bass Fellow.
