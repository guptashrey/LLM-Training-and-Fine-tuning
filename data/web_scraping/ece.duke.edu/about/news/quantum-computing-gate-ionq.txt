# Duke University and IonQ Develop New Quantum Computing Gate, Only Possible
on IonQ and Duke Systems

February 10, 2022

Researchers discover a new method to perform the N-qubit Toffoli gate, a more
efficient quantum operation helpful in scaling quantum algorithms

New family of N-qubit gates can only be run on IonQ quantum computer
architecture

Once implemented, gate is expected to speed up several fundamental algorithms
for quantum computing

Press release written and distributed by IonQ

DURHAM, N.C. & COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Today, the Duke Quantum Center (DQC) at
Duke University and IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) announced the invention of a new quantum
computing operation with the potential to accelerate several key quantum
computing techniques and contribute to scaling quantum algorithms. The new
quantum gate is a novel way to operate on many connected qubits at once and
leverages the multi-qubit communication bus available only on IonQ and DQC
quantum computers. Full details of the gate technique can be found on the
preprint archive arXiv at arXiv:2202.04230.

The new gate family includes the N-qubit Toffoli gate, which flips a select
qubit if and only if all the other qubits are in a particular state. Unlike
standard two-qubit quantum computing gates, the N-qubit Toffoli gate acts on
many qubits at once, leading to more efficient operations. The gate appears
naturally in many common quantum algorithms.

IonQ and Duke’s discovery may lead to significant efficiency gains in solving
fundamental quantum algorithms, such as Grover’s search algorithm, variational
quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), and arithmetic operations like addition and
multiplication. These use cases are ubiquitous across quantum computing
applications, and are core to IonQ’s work in quantum chemistry, quantum
finance, and quantum machine learning. They are also key components of
commonly accepted industry benchmarks for quantum computers, which have
already shown IonQ’s computers to be clear industry leaders.

“This discovery is an example of us continuing to build on the leading
technical architecture we've established. It adds to the unique and powerful
capabilities we are developing for quantum computing applications," said Peter
Chapman, CEO at IonQ.

This research, conducted at Duke by Dr. Or Katz, Prof. Marko Cetina, and IonQ
co-Founder and Chief Scientist Prof. Christopher Monroe, will be integrated
into IonQ’s quantum computing operating system for the general public to use.
Monroe notes that, “no other available quantum computing architectures—not
even other ion-based quantum computers—are able to utilize this new family of
N-qubit gates. This is because IonQ’s quantum computers uniquely feature full
connectivity and a wide communication bus that allows all qubits to talk to
each other simultaneously.”

This discovery follows a series of announcements around IonQ’s research
efforts and preparations for scale. In December, IonQ announced that it plans
to use barium ions as qubits in its systems, bringing about a wave of
advantages it believes will enable advanced quantum computing architectures.
Last year, the team also debuted the industry’s first Reconfigurable Multicore
Quantum Architecture and Evaporated Glass Trap technology, both of which are
expected to contribute to scaling the number of qubits in IonQ’s quantum
computers.
