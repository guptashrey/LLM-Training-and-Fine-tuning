# Krishnendu Chakrabarty Named a Fellow of the Association for Computing
Machinery

December 12, 2013

Chakrabarty is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke

Krishnendu Chakrabarty, professor of electrical and computer engineering at
Pratt, was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery today.
Along with 49 of his peers from around the world, Chakrabarty was recognized
for his contributions to computing that are driving innovations across
multiple domains and disciplines.

Specifically, Chakrabarty was cited for his work developing optimization
methods for system-on-chip test automation, microfluidic biochips and sensor
network infrastructure. The group will be recognized at the the 2013 Fellows
at its annual Awards Banquet on June 21, 2014, in San Francisco.

It is Chakrabarty's second honor in as many months, as in November he was
elected to receive the Humboldt Research Award, granted by the Alexander von
Humboldt Foundation to "outstanding researchers whose fundamental discoveries,
new theories, or insights have had a significant impact on their own
discipline and who are expected to continue producing cutting-edge
achievements in the future."

outrageously ambitious
