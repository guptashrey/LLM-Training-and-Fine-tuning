# Pfister Co-Authors Top Computer Science Theory Paper

April 18, 2016

Henry Pfister, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and
member of the Information Initiative at Duke, and his coauthors have received
a best paper award from the Symposium on the Theory of Computing 2016.

Henry Pfister, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and
member of the Information Initiative at Duke, and his coauthors have received
a best paper award from the Symposium on the Theory of Computing 2016.

One of the top computer science theory conferences in the world, the symposium
names only three papers as award winners each year. The award will be
presented during the three-day conference in Cambridge, Mass., on June 18,
2016.

The paper, titled “Reed-Muller Codes Achieve Capacity on Erasure Channels,”
introduces a new approach to proving that a sequence of deterministic linear
codes achieves capacity on an erasure channel. The work shows that, for
certain sequences of linear codes, symmetry alone is sufficient to guarantee
they achieve capacity.

The other authors of the paper are Shrinivas Kudekar (Qualcomm, Inc.),
Santhosh Kumar (Texas A&M University), Marco Mondelli (Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology, Lausanne), Eren Şaşoğlu (Intel Corporation), and Rüdiger
Urbanke (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne).
