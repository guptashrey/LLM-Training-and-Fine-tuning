# Curtarolo Wins Humboldt Foundation's Bessel Research Prize

March 25, 2016

Curtarolo’s research centers on accelerated materials development, by creating
intelligent algorithms to characterize structure/properties relationships.

Stefano Curtarolo, professor of mechanical engineering and materials science
and director of the Center for Materials Genomics at Duke, has been named one
of this year’s recipients of the Bessel Prize given by the Humboldt
Foundation.

The Bessel Prize is given to roughly 20 researchers each year who are
internationally renowned in their field and have completed their doctorates
less than 15 years. These award winners are expected to continue producing
cutting-edge achievements which will have a seminal influence on their
discipline beyond their immediate field of work. The award was given for the
pioneering role of Curtarolo in the Materials Genome Initiative.

Bessel Prize winners are invited to spend up to a year exploring long-term
research projects with colleagues at a research institution in Germany, which
may be divided up into blocks.

Curtarolo’s research centers on accelerated materials development, by creating
intelligent algorithms to characterize structure/properties relationships.
This is performed through big-data-mining of large databases containing the
thermochemical and electrical properties. His work provides detailed “recipes”
for creating the most efficient combinations of elements and atoms for a
specific purpose, sort of like a materials’ cookbook. The repository,
organized as a multi-university consortium sponsored by the Department of
Defense, is free and open to all www.aflowlib.org.

outrageously ambitious
