# Duke Engineering Launches Institute for Enterprise Engineering

April 27, 2021

New organization will increase opportunities for professional education,
industry partnerships focused on applying technological innovation to
enterprises

As computational technologies continue to advance, there is no shortage of
organizations beginning to understand just how valuable these innovations can
be to their business. Digital tools like data analytics, artificial
intelligence, machine learning and blockchain that not long ago were thought
of as experimental pursuits for academics are transforming most every field
imaginable.

To meet the evolving needs of industries big and small for talent in these
areas, the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University is launching the
Institute for Enterprise Engineering. The new initiative will leverage Duke
Engineering’s existing strengths in applied computational technologies and
industry-focused professional education to open new opportunities for both
Duke students and working professionals around the world. Its goal is to
create technical leaders who can enhance organizational performance and
product innovation through engineering and technology.

“Duke Engineering has already launched a number of independent programs that
address this growing need and we are now putting them together into a more
coherent and easily navigated framework,” said Jeff Glass, senior associate
dean for education and learning innovation at Duke Engineering. “Not only will
this help working professionals see what we have to offer them, it will help
us bring a greater industry presence, which has already proven invaluable in
many courses, into more of our programs.”

> “With the rapid pace of change and opportunity for applying technology to
> solve industry problems, it is exciting to see Duke Engineering lead in
> bringing such a timely and nimble model of education that fits the speed of
> innovation in industry.”

“As a complement to Duke Engineering’s existing degree programs concentrated
on the traditional engineering disciplines, the institute will focus on
creating industry-centered programs and courses in technology areas that cut
across boundaries, such as AI or cybersecurity,” said Jon Reifschneider,
director of professional programs at Duke Engineering.

The institute will be composed of two main branches, each housing existing
academic programs in addition to new offerings. One is the Center for
Engineering Management, the centerpiece of which is Duke Engineering’s Master
of Engineering Management degree program, started nearly 25 years ago and
highly regarded for both its on-campus and online programs and its integration
of real industry experiences. The second is the Center for Enterprise
Analytics and Systems Engineering, which includes the school’s educational
offerings in areas such as FinTech, cybersecurity, blockchain and AI.

Developed by Reifschneider with input from leaders across industries, Duke
Engineering’s recently launched AI for Product Innovation Master of
Engineering embodies many of the characteristics the new institute will look
to advance. Collaborating with faculty from Duke’s Sanford School of Public
Policy and School of Law, courses build a deep appreciation of the business,
policy and ethical considerations of implementing AI and machine learning in
addition to the requisite technical skills. It is also structured around the
Product Development Process used in industry and incorporates real-world
projects, so that students understand how to translate what they learn in the
classroom into the development of new products and systems. And as with most
of the programs in the new Institute, it’s offered in both on-campus and
online formats to meet the needs of full-time working professionals.

It is this combination of campus-wide expertise, curriculum centered on
industry practices and partnership with real-world professionals that the
Institute for Enterprise Engineering will work to implement into stackable,
industry-focused educational programs in each focus area. Offerings such as
weekend or week-long immersive short courses will allow professionals to brush
up on or try out a new subject. For those interested in diving deeper, options
could include a three-course Master Track on the Coursera virtual learning
platform, a for-credit Duke Graduate Certificate or even a full online
professional master’s degree.

“In 1967, Duke decided that if you took mechanical and electrical engineering
and applied it to health, it warranted the creation of a new field, and they
called it biomedical engineering. Duke was one of the first schools to take
this leap and is now one of the leaders in this enormous field,” said Ravi
Bellamkonda, Vinik Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke. “We
believe that the application of AI, machine learning and data science to
businesses and enterprise is analogous to this transformation, and Duke is
poised to become a leader in defining the birth of this new field.”

“I think we’ll look back in 10 years and think about how remarkable it was to
make this major shift in how master’s programs are built,” said Glass.
“Learning in the context of the product development process and engaging
professionals with real-world problems in these classes make the lessons
learned generalizable to any company no matter what specific industry niche
they operate in.”

Besides developing curricula tailored to industry needs, the institute will
also bring more industry professionals to Duke’s campus in a wide variety of
ways such as roundtables, seminars, practicums and internships. Capstone
projects will become more formalized with various companies to allow students
to work on authentic industry problems. And the increased ties with industry
will also bleed over into the undergraduate experience by providing unique
“vertical learning“ graduate-level electives and co-curricular opportunities.

This April, to name just one example, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation announced a strategic partnership with Duke Engineering to drive
technological innovation in the banking and financial services sectors. The
partnership will engage students and faculty across a range of Enterprise
Engineering programs, particularly in FinTech and cybersecurity.

“With the rapid pace of change and opportunity for applying technology to
solve industry problems, it is exciting to see Duke Engineering lead in
bringing such a timely and nimble model of education that fits the speed of
innovation in industry,” said Mike Salvino, president and CEO of DXC
Technology and member of the Duke Engineering Board of Visitors.

“Until now, you’ve essentially only had two chances to get a Duke
education—once when choosing your undergraduate institution and once when
considering graduate school,” said Reifschneider. “Now we’re looking to
accommodate the different needs of people at different points in their careers
and provide unlimited opportunities to learn from Duke no matter what career
stage they’re in.”
