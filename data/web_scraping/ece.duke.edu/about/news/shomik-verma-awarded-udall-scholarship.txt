# Shomik Verma Awarded Udall Scholarship

April 12, 2018

Verma, a junior Mechanical Engineering student, focuses his talents on energy
research

Duke Engineering student Shomik Verma is the recipient of a 2018 Udall
Scholarship, which recognizes students who have demonstrated a commitment to
careers in the environment or Native American tribal public policy or health
care.

Verma is also the recent recipient of a 2018 Goldwater Scholarship for his
engineering research, which focuses on the design and implementation of
sustainable technologies. He is president of the Duke Energy club, has worked
with Duke’s Energy Initiative to create three new assistantships for students
to do energy research with faculty, and is vice president of the Duke SMART
home, where residents live in a LEED Platinum building and work on
sustainability issues.

Shomik has a strong passion for research and the topic of renewable and
sustainable energy and his motivation is combined with exceptional fundamental
skills and analytical abilities,” said Nico Hotz, Verma’s research adviser in
Duke’s Thermodynamics and Sustainable Energy Lab. “During my years of
mentoring students and supervising their research, I have hardly ever seen a
student as talented and hard-working as Shomik.”

The Udall Scholarship gives recipients access to an alumni network of
influencers in their field of interest, and comes with a monetary prize of up
to $7000 that may be applied toward their academic expenses.

Verma is one of three Duke University students to receive the nationally
competitive scholarship this year. Read more on Duke Today.
