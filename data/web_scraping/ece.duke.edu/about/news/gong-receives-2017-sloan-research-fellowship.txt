# Gong Receives 2017 Sloan Research Fellowship

February 22, 2017

Gong will use the award to continue his research probing neural activity with
high spatial and temporal precision using genetic sensors that glow in
response to neural signals

Yiyang Gong, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University,
has been named a recipient of a 2017 Sloan Research Fellowship.

Awarded annually to 126 early career researchers in recognition of
distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial
contributions to their field, the award provides a two-year, $60,000 grant to
support each researcher’s work. Candidates must have received their PhD on or
after September 1, 2010, and work in chemistry, computational or evolutionary
molecular biology, computer science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience,
ocean sciences, physics or a related field.

Since the beginning of the program, 43 Sloan Fellows have earned Nobel Prizes,
16 have won the Fields Medal in mathematics, 68 have received the National
Medal of Science, and 15 have won the John Bates Clark Medal in economics.

Gong will use the award to continue his research probing neural activity with
high spatial and temporal precision using genetic sensors that glow in
response to neural signals. Bits of DNA are delivered to neurons through a
virus and encode a protein that sits on the cell membrane and responds to
voltages coming from the neuron.

Gong’s goal is to target specific types of neurons and directly record the
various types of voltage waveforms that different neurons create. The past few
years have seen Gong improve the sensitivity of these genetic sensors and
successfully demonstrate their use in cell cultures, intact tissues and a live
mouse.
