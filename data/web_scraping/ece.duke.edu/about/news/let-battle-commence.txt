# Let Battle Commence

October 2, 2019

A new student club brings fighting robots to the Innovation Co-Lab

Five teams of Duke students convened at the Innovation Co-Lab this weekend to
see whose small robot would smash, grind, or body-slam its way to victory in
the Duke Combat Robotics Club’s first tournament.

More than 40 students registered for the tournament, which began with a
hackathon-style introduction to the 3D modeling software needed to design
their tiny terrors. The Combat Robotics Club provided materials including
electronic components, bearings, shafts, and pizza, and the competing teams
used the Co-Lab’s 3D printers to fabricate wheels and body parts—in addition
to serrated spinning disks, shovels, and other implements of destruction.

The team’s president and co-founder, Ethan Cheung ME’21, said that the format
of the competition, which is modeled after the Discovery Channel’s popular
“BattleBots” program, naturally encourages participants to think about why
designs fail, and how to improve upon them for the next competition. Cheung
hopes that, in addition to honing the skills of declared engineering students,
the Combat Robotics Team will introduce engineering to some Duke students who
may not have considered it before.

“Personally,” said Cheung, “I'm just excited for the opportunity to build
things, break things, and learn things.”

At the end of the tournament, Alex Oesterling BME’22 and Frank Tang ECE/CS’22
took the prize (dinner at the Commons and a custom trophy), with a robot whose
spinning metal-studded jaw tore up the competition.
