# Pratt Junior Rohin Maganti Named Goldwater Scholar

April 1, 2020

Biomedical engineering major from Dallas helps lead Hindu Students Association

_From Duke Today_

Duke University junior Rohin Maganti is among the 396 undergraduate students
from around the country awarded the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship.

This federally endowed award encourages students to pursue careers in the
fields of mathematics, the natural sciences and engineering.

The Goldwater Scholars, announced Friday, were chosen on the basis of academic
merit from a pool of 1,343 natural science, engineering and mathematics
students nominated by the institutional representatives of 461 colleges and
universities nationwide. Virtually all scholars intend to obtain a Ph.D.

Maganti, a biomedical engineering major from Dallas, plans to pursue a medical
degree and Ph.D. in cancer biology.

While at Duke, Maganti has worked in the lab of Dr. Scott Floyd under the
mentorship of medical/Ph.D. student Drake Edwards, studying the molecular
mechanisms that drive DNA damage response pathways with the ultimate goal of
improving cancer therapies. Maganti aspires to become a professor of cancer
biology at an academic research institution.

Maganti’s other biomedical engineering projects at Duke include a technology
that helps prevent adverse outcomes associated with sleep deprivation in the
hospital. The project received the Baquerizo Innovation Grant from the Pratt
School of Engineering, and a Bass Connections Independent Research Award in
2019.

Beyond his research interests, Maganti helps lead the Hindu Students
Association, is a member of the Duke Raas dance team and completed a summer
study abroad project with DukeEngage in the Philippines.

Since its first award in 1989, the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence
in Education Foundation has awarded 9,047 scholarships worth approximately $71
million. Including Maganti, Duke students have won 85 Goldwater scholarships
since 1990.

outrageously ambitious
