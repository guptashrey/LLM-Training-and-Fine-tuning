# Wiesner Appointed to U.S. EPA Science Advisory Board

February 5, 2019

CEE chair and professor Mark Wiesner will use decades of experience and
knowledge regarding water quality and use to help guide the agency's programs
and plans

Mark Wiesner, the James B. Duke Professor and chair of civil and environmental
engineering at Duke University, has been appointed to the Science Advisory
Board of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

With eight new board members appointed to three-year terms, the Science
Advisory Board will have a total membership of 45 in FY2019. Their role is to
review the quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information
being used by the EPA, review EPA research programs and plans, provide science
advice as requested by the EPA Administrator, and advise the agency on broad
scientific matters.

“In a fair, open, and transparent fashion, EPA reviewed hundreds of qualified
applicants nominated for this committee,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew
Wheeler. “Members who will be appointed or reappointed include experts from a
wide variety of scientific disciplines who reflect the geographic diversity
needed to represent all ten EPA regions.”

Wiesner was tapped for his expertise in engineering, drinking water, water
quality, and water quantity for reuse. For the past decade, he has led the
Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology (CEINT) at Duke,
which has been a lynchpin in the global effort to understand how nanoparticles
are transported through the environment and their potential toxicity to
ecosystems.

outrageously ambitious
