# Photo Essay: Duke Engineers for International Development in 2015

November 11, 2015

Duke student teams worked with communities in Uganda, Honduras, Rwanda and
Costa Rica

Duke Engineers for International Development (DEID) is a student organization
that sends student-led groups to locations around the globe to assess and
implement engineering projects that spur development. After working with
communities to identify their needs, the teams collaborate with professors and
professional mentors during the school year to design solutions that are
implemented in the following summer.

In 2015, four teams went abroad to help construct a variety of engineering
needs in communities in Uganda, Honduras, Rwanda and Costa Rica. From clean-
cooking stoves to the construction of a bridge over an often-flooded river
bed, these students helped make a direct difference in the lives of hundreds
of people.

Read more about their projects below and see some of their handiwork below.
