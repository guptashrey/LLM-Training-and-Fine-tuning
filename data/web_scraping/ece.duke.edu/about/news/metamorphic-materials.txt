# Artificial Soft Surface Autonomously Mimics Shapes From Nature

September 21, 2022 | By Ken Kingery

Soft surface adapts and reshapes itself to match a wide array of objects and
motions

Engineers at Duke University have developed a scalable soft surface that can
continuously reshape itself to mimic objects in nature. Relying on
electromagnetic actuation, mechanical modeling and machine learning to form
new configurations, the surface can even learn to adapt to hindrances such as
broken elements, unexpected constraints or changing environments.

The research appears online September 21 in the journal Nature.

“We’re motivated by the idea of controlling material properties or mechanical
behaviors of an engineered object on the fly, which could be useful for
applications like soft robotics, augmented reality, biomimetic materials, and
subject-specific wearables,” said Xiaoyue Ni, assistant professor of
mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke. “We are focusing on
engineering the shape of matter that hasn’t been predetermined, which is a
pretty tall task to achieve, especially for soft materials.”

Previous work on morphing matter, according to Ni, hasn’t typically been
programmable; it’s been programmed instead. That is, soft surfaces equipped
with designed active elements can shift their shapes between few shapes, like
a piece of origami, in response to light or heat or other stimuli triggers. In
contrast, Ni and her laboratory wanted to create something much more
controllable that could morph and reconfigure as often as it likes into any
physically possible shapes.

To create such a surface, the researchers started by laying out a grid of
snake-like beams made of a thin layer of gold encapsulated by a thin polymer
layer. The individual beams are just eight micrometers thick—about the
thickness of a cotton fiber—and less than a millimeter wide. The lightness of
the beams allows magnetic forces to easily and rapidly deform them.

To generate local forces, the surface is put into a low-level static magnetic
field. Voltage changes create a complex but easily predictable electrical
current along the golden grid, driving the out-of-plane displacement of the
grid.

“This is the first artificial soft surface that is fast enough to accurately
mimic a continuous shape-shifting process in nature,” Ni said. “One key
advance is the structural design that enables an unusual linear relationship
between the electrical inputs and the resulting shape, which makes it easy to
figure out how to apply voltages to achieve a wide variety of target shapes.”

The new “metasurface” shows off a wide array of morphing and mimicking skills.
It creates bulges that rise and move around the surface like a cat trying to
find its way out from under a blanket, oscillating wave patterns, and a
convincing replication of a liquid drop dripping and plopping onto a solid
surface. And it produces these shapes and behaviors at any speed or
acceleration desired, meaning it can reimagine that trapped cat or dripped
droplet in slow motion or fast forward.

> eventually improve the feedback system and learning algorithm to the point
> that it’s nearly real-time.”

With cameras monitoring the morphing surface, the contortionist surface can
also learn to recreate shapes and patterns on its own. By slowly adjusting the
applied voltages, a learning algorithm takes in 3D imaging feedback and
figures out what effects the different inputs have on the metasurface’s shape.

In the paper, a human palm spotted with 16 black dots slowly shifts under a
camera, and the surface mirrors the movements perfectly.

“The control doesn’t have to know anything about the physics of the materials,
it just takes small steps and watches to see if it’s getting closer to the
target or not,” Ni said. “It currently takes about two minutes to achieve a
new shape, but we hope to eventually improve the feedback system and learning
algorithm to the point that it’s nearly real-time.”

Because the surface teaches itself to move through trial and error, it can
also adapt to damage, unexpected physical constraints or environmental change.
In one experiment, it quickly learns to mimic a bulging mound despite one of
its beams being cut. In another, it manages to mimic a similar shape despite a
weight being attached to one of the grid’s nodes.

There are many immediate opportunities to extend the scale and configuration
of the soft surface. For example, an array of surfaces can scale the size up
to that of a touching screen. Or fabrication techniques with higher precision
can scale the size down to one millimeter, making it more suitable for
biomedical applications.

Moving forward, Ni wants to create robotic metasurfaces with integrated shape-
sensing functions to perform real-time shape mimicking of complex, dynamic
surfaces in nature, such as the water ripples, fish fins or the human face.
The lab may also look into embedding more components into the prototype, such
as on-board power sources, sensors, computational resources or wireless
communication capabilities.

“Along with the pursuit of creating programmable and robotic materials, we
envision future materials will be able to alter themselves to serve functions
dynamically and interactively,” said Ni. “Such materials can sense and
perceive requirements or information from the users, and transform and adapt
according to the real-time needs of their specific performance, just like the
microbots in Big Hero 6. The soft surface may find applications as a
teleoperated robot, dynamic 3D display, camouflage, exoskeleton or other
smart, functional surfaces that can work in harsh, unpredictable
environments.”

The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (CMMI 16-35443).
This work was performed in part at the Duke University Shared Materials
Instrumentation Facility (SMIF), a member of the North Carolina Research
Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN), which is supported by the National
Science Foundation (ECCS-2025064).
