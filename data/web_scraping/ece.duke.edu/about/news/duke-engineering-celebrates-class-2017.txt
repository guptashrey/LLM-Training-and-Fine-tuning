# Duke Engineering Celebrates Class of 2017

May 14, 2017

Dean Ravi Bellamkonda and the Pratt faculty awarded more than 500 degrees to
undergraduate and graduate engineering students of the Class of 2017.

Duke University awarded more than 500 degrees to undergraduate and graduate
engineering students on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, May 12 through 14, during
a weekend of commencement exercises that began with diploma ceremonies for
professional master’s degree students, continued with a university-wide
ceremony at Wallace Wade Stadium and concluded with Pratt School of
Engineering celebrations in Cameron Indoor Stadium.

YouTube. See selected photos from Commencement Weekend on Facebook.

Philanthropist and financier David Rubenstein delivered the university’s
commencement address on Sunday morning, while Dean Ravi V. Bellamkonda and
senior class president Uzoma Bailey Ayogu spoke at the undergraduate
engineering school ceremony held Sunday afternoon. Bellamkonda and the Pratt
faculty awarded Bachelor of Science in Engineering diplomas to 296 students
(there were 315 students total for the Class of 2017, which includes students
who earned degrees during the fall semester).

The Class of 2017 includes 90 Master of Science and 80 PhD engineering
graduates. The 2017 Master of Science graduates include students who are
continuing their studies toward doctoral degrees. Sixty-seven Master of
Engineering Management (MEM) and 13 Master of Engineering (MEng) degrees were
awarded during the 2016-2017 academic year.

All told, the Pratt Class of 2017 includes 565 students.

Overall, Duke awarded degrees to more than 5,300 undergraduate, graduate and
professional degrees to students who are graduating this spring. Students who
graduated in September or December 2016 were invited to participate in
Sunday's ceremony.

Many students were honored with special awards and prizes for outstanding
scholarly achievement and student leadership. Their names and the honors they
