# Steve Cummer Named Fellow of the American Geophysical Union

July 27, 2016

Cummer is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke

Steve Cummer, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke
University, has been elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union. The
honor is bestowed upon only 0.1 percent of the society’s membership in any
given year and recognizes scientific eminence in the Earth and space sciences.
It acknowledges Fellows for their remarkable contributions to their research
fields, exceptional knowledge and visionary leadership.

Much of Cummer’s geophysical research focuses on lightning, including
developing new imaging systems that can follow a lightning bolt as it
propagates through a cloud, and also studying unusual effects produced by
lightning, such as gigantic jets, sprites, and high-energy terrestrial gamma
ray flashes. He is also known for his work with metamaterials, developing
acoustic applications such as a 3-D acoustic cloaking device and a method for
harnessing “lost” power through pervasive WiFi and satellite communications
waves, among others.

Cummer and the other 59 newly named Fellows will be recognized at the annual
Honors Tribute to be held on December 14 at the 2016 AGU Fall Meeting in San
Francisco. The American Geophysical Union consists of over 62,000 members from
144 countries. Its goal is to galvanize a community of Earth and space
scientists that collaboratively advances and communicates science and its
power to ensure a sustainable future.

outrageously ambitious
