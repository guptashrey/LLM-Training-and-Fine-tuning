## Presenter

• David Carlson, PhD; Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, Assistant Professor in Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Assistant
Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Assistant
Professor of Computer Science • Jessica Sperling, PhD; Director, Office of
Evaluation and Applied Research Partnership (Director, AREE, SSRI; Director,
Evaluation & Strategic Planning, CTSI) • James Tcheng, MD; Professor of
Medicine, Assistant Dean for Academic Appointments, Professor of Family
Medicine and Community Health and • Shelley Rusincovitch, MMCi; Managing
Director, Duke AI Health

The application of artificial intelligence in health settings holds great
potential, but there are many considerations and concerns for the safe and
responsible integration of these powerful methods. In this one-hour virtual
seminar, we'll discuss these considerations with 2 experts: Dr. Tcheng, who is
an interventional cardiologist and clinical informaticist; and Dr. Carlson,
who is a quantitative and machine learning expert; and Dr. Sperling, who is an
expert in evaluation and applied/community-engaged research methods. Through
their complementary areas of expertise, we'll explore perspectives on the
current state and future development of ethics and safety in cutting-edge AI
methods and applications, with a particular focus on health and clinical
settings.
