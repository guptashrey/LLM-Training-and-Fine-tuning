Abstract:  
Deep neural networks use the computational power of massively parallel
processors in applications such as autonomous driving. Autonomous driving
demands resiliency (as in reliability, availability and safety) and
performance (trillions of operations per second) to process sensor data with
extreme accuracy. This talk examines various approaches to achieve resiliency
in autonomous cars and makes the case for design diversity-based redundancy as
a viable solution.  
  
Biography:  
Nirmal R. Saxena currently leads NVIDIA's effort on HPC and Resilient Compute
Architecture. Prior to NVIDIA (1984-2015), Nirmal held technical and
management roles in several semiconductor, computer and networking companies.
He was also associated with Stanford University's Center for Reliable
Computing and EE Department (1991-2009). He taught courses in Logic Design,
Computer Architecture, Fault-Tolerant Computing, and was co-investigator with
Professor Edward J. McCluskey on DARPA's ROAR (Reliability Obtained through
Adaptive Reconfiguration) project.  
  
Nirmal received his BE ECE degree (1982) from Osmania University, India; MSEE
degree (1984) from the University of Iowa; and Ph.D. EE degree (1991) from
Stanford University. He is a Fellow of IEEE (2002) and was cited for his
contributions to reliable computing.
