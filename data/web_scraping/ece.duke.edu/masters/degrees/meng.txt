Financial Aid and Fellowships

    

Because the Master of Engineering is a professional degree rather than a
research degree, most students pay their own tuition costs. Many students take
out loans and believe there will be an excellent return on investment when
they get out into the workforce.

#### Diversity Scholarships

Underrepresented minorities may receive up to 50 percent per year in tuition
scholarship through our Diversity Scholarships.

#### Externally Funded Scholarships

We also offer support to recipients of select competitively externally funded
scholarships, such as

  * National Science Foundation (NSF) Fellowships
  * Fulbright Scholar Program

#### DoD SMART Scholarship Program

**For US Citizens only –** The Science, Mathematics And Research for
Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service Program has been established by
the Department of Defense (DoD) to support undergraduate and graduate students
pursuing degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
disciplines. The program aims to increase the number of civilian scientists
and engineers working at DoD laboratories.
