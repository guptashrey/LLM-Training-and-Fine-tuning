# Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

## Breadcrumb

  1. Home
  2. Undergraduate
  3. Degrees

Complement your major with a minor in the field of ML/AI

The Minor in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence requires the
completion of a minimum of five (5) technical courses.

This education offering is an outgrowth of Duke ECE's global research
leadership in AI and machine learning **.**

To provide sufficient foundational breadth, three (3) courses are drawn from
identified core areas fundamental to the discipline. Students tailor their
course of study through selecting two (2) upper-level (300-level or above)
focus courses

  * Requirements
  * Pre-requisites

* * *

## Detailed Requirements

### Fundamental Courses

Required

  * Intermediate Statistics/Probability—ECE 480: Applied Probability for
    Statistical Learning
  * Introductory Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence—ECE 580:
    Introduction to Machine Learning
  * Intermediate Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence course—ECE 682D/CS
    571D/Stat 561D _or_ ECE 687D/CS 671D/STA 671D

### Upper-Level Focus Courses

Choose two (2)

  * ECE 585: Signal Detection and Extraction Theory
  * ECE 588: Image & Video Processing
  * ECE 661: Computer Engineering Machine Learning & Deep Neural Networks
  * ECE 662: Machine Learning Acceleration & Neuromorphic Computing
  * ECE 684: Natural Language Processing
  * ECE 685D: Deep Learning
  * CompSci 527: Computer Vision
  * Math 412: Topological Data Analysis
  * Math 465/CompSci 445: Introduction to High Dimensional Data Analysis
  * Stat 340: Introduction to Statistical Decision Analysis
  * Stat 360: Bayesian Inference and Modern Statistical Methods
  * ECE 590: Special Topics courses on machine learning and artificial
    intelligence topics (with DUS approval)

### Important Notes

  * Courses that are used to fulfill the student’s major(s) may not be double-
    counted toward the minor
  * Courses with content substantially equivalent to courses in the student's
    major(s) may not be counted toward the minor
  * Students with credit for any of the Fundamental Courses (e.g., exact or
    equivalent course taken to satisfy a requirement of the major(s)) may
    substitute additional Upper-Level Focus courses from the approved list
    above. The Director of Undergraduate Studies in ECE must approve such
    exceptions.
  * At most, one Independent Study course (approved the DUS in ECE) may be
    used to fulfill one of the upper-level elective requirements.

* * *

## Pre-requisites

It is expected that a student pursuing a Minor in Machine Learning &
Artificial Intelligence will satisfy all prerequisites for each course
selected for their minor program.

This will typically involve completion of courses in Math, Statistics, and
Computer Science, which are pre-requisites for the fundamental and elective
courses.

Specifically, the following prerequisite knowledge is assumed:

  * Mid-level programming course (e.g., CS 201)
  * Linear algebra (e.g., Math 216, 218, 218D-2, 221)
  * Introductory statistics (e.g., EGR 238L, ECE 380, ECE 555, Stat/Math 230,
    Stat 240L)

Exceptions may be granted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies in ECE, for
example, if a student’s preparation is deemed equivalent to the pre-requisite.
