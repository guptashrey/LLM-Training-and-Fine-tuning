Complete five courses—Earn a notation on your Duke transcript

Students pursuing a major in ECE may focus their course selection within the
major by following a defined thematic pathway within the major.

Successful completion of all requirements will result in a designation of "
**Concentration in Machine Learning** " on the official transcript.

> The Concentration in ML does _**not**_ require additional courses

ECE majors can declare this concentration by selecting this option on the
Pratt Declaration of Major form

Completion of the Concentration in Machine Learning requires a minimum of 5
courses.

These requirements can be met within the general requirements of the ECE major
and do not require any _additional_ courses; however, the _choice_ of classes
has been constrained to fit the Concentration requirements.
