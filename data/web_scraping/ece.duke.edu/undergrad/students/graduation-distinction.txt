# Graduation with Departmental Distinction

## Breadcrumb

  3. Students

Students conduct supervised research and present their results to faculty

Students who aspire to Graduate with Departmental Distinction within the Duke
Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering conduct supervised research
through independent study courses and present the results of individual
research and study in written and oral forms to the department's faculty.

Those candidates who are judged by the faculty to have distinguished
themselves through their paper and presentation earn Graduation with
Departmental Distinction honors.

This accomplishment is recognized when the BSE degree is awarded. If that time
is different from the principal Spring commencement exercises, the student
work remains in contention for the **Sherrerd Memorial Undergraduate Research
Award** for that academic year.

## Requirements

To be considered for Graduation with Departmental Distinction a student must:

  * Have a 3.5 cumulative GPA
  * Successfully complete in his or her senior year a faculty-supervised
    Independent Study Project with significant Electrical and Computer
    Engineering accomplishment
  * Demonstrate the significance of this project in a formal written report
    and defended in an oral presentation before a committee of faculty members

* * *

## Submitting the Report

Candidates must submit a 10-20 page written report (single-spaced, 12-point
Times New Roman, single column) including figures and references.

The entire report must be submitted electronically to the Director of
Undergraduate Studies Assistant, Ms. Jaleesa Singleton, at
jaleesa.singleton@duke.edu, typically **ten days before** the oral
presentation begins.

The project report essentially constitutes a senior thesis.
