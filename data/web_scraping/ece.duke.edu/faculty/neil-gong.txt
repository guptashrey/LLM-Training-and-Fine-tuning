Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Neil Gong is interested in cybersecurity and data privacy with a recent focus
on the intersections between security, privacy, and machine learning. On one
hand, he leverages machine learning techniques to study security and privacy.
On the other hand, he builds secure and privacy-preserving machine learning.
He has received an NSF CAREER Award, an Army Research Office (ARO) Young
Investigator Award, an IBM Faculty Award, and an NDSS Distinguished Paper
Award Honorable Mention. He received a B.E. from the University of Science and
Technology of China in 2010 (with the highest honor) and a Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 2015. During
2015-2019, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.
