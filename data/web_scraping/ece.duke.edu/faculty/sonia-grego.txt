Associate Research Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering

I am the founding director of the Duke Smart Toilet Lab, dedicated to the
opportunities that data-rich human excreta offer to improve individual and
public health. The objective is to empower individuals and groups in communal
living with health information for early warning of disease, health and
wellness and management of chronic diseases through wastewater analysis,
without any changes of daily habits. I am passionate about the opportunities
that advanced sanitation technologies offer to improve global health and to
provide a paradigm shift in health screening both for individuals and for
communities.

As a major project of my research portfolio over the past 5 years, I have led
the field testing of 10+ onsite sanitation technology prototypes from multiple
organizations in international settings. I have managed yearlong deployments
of sophisticated chemo-mechanical systems with electronic monitoring connected
to wastewater pipes of buildings, ensuring no disruption of service to users
while evaluating the treatment process performance.
