Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Henry D. Pfister received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2003 from the
University of California, San Diego and is currently a professor in the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Duke University with a
secondary appointment in Mathematics. Prior to that, he was an associate
professor at Texas A&M University (2006-2014), a post-doctoral fellow at the
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (2005-2006), and a senior engineer at
Qualcomm Corporate R&D in San Diego (2003-2004). His current research
interests include information theory, error-correcting codes, quantum
computing, and machine learning.

He received the NSF Career Award in 2008 and a Texas A&M ECE Department
Outstanding Professor Award in 2010. He is a coauthor of the 2007 IEEE COMSOC
best paper in Signal Processing and Coding for Data Storage and a coauthor of
a 2016 Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) best paper. He has served
the IEEE Information Theory Society as a member of the Board of Governors
(2019-2022), an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory (2013-2016), and a Distinguished Lecturer (2015-2016). He was also the
General Chair of the 2016 North American School of Information Theory.
