Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Jeffrey Krolik is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke
University in Durham, NC. Canadian-born, he received his Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering from the University of Toronto in 1987. He began his academic
career as an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
Concordia University in Montreal. Interested in signal processing applications
in the ocean sciences, he joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California San Diego as an Assistant Research Scientist in 1990.
At Scripps, he developed physics-based sensor array processing methods that
exploit multi-path underwater acoustic propagation. Since coming to Duke in
1992, he has broadened his research interests to include statistical signal
processing for surveillance radars and microwave remote sensing, active and
passive sonar, and medical imaging. Some of his current projects include the
development of aircraft height finding for over-the-horizon HF radar, through-
the-sensor environmental monitoring of near-surface atmospheric conditions
using a shipboard microwave radar, active sonar array shape estimation from
reverberation, and functional magnetic resonance imaging algorithms which are
robust to head motion. As a consultant, he has worked for the Office of Naval
Research, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Air Force
Rome Laboratories.
