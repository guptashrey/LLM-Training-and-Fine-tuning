Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering

I work with domain experts across different fields to solve challenging real-
world problems through the application or development of advanced signal
processing, computer vision, machine learning (especially deep learning)
methods to real-world problems. Recently, my work has spanned topics such as
remote sensing, energy systems, and materials science. My work has recently
been featured in premiere machine learning conferences (e.g., NeurIps, ICLR)
and computer vision conferences (e.g., WACV).
