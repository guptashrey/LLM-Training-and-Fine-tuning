  1. Home
  2. Faculty

Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering

Over the last two decades Dr. Morizio's research has been focused on CMOS
mixed-signal microelectronics and ASICs used in translational closed-loop,
bioelectronic therapies for wireless neural interfaces. These interfaces
include sub-system architectures for neural recording and modulation and
analog circuits for low noise preamplifier, high channel count multiplexer and
programmable current sources. Dr. Morizio's current research is focused on
biomedical instrumentation intended for neurological, digestive and immune
system disorders with the research goal for human clinical translation. He has
over 35 years of analog circuit design experience in industry and academics
and co-inventor of 8 patents.
