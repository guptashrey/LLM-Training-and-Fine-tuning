Michael J. Fitzpatrick Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Photonics

David Brady leads the Duke Information Spaces Project (DISP). Historically,
DISP has focused on computational imaging systems, with particular emphasis on
smart cameras for security, consumer, transportation and broadcast
applications. Currently DISP focuses primarily on the use of artificial
intelligence in camera arrays for interactive broadcasting.

## Research Interests

Professor Brady's research focuses on "smart cameras" which use artificial
intelligence to increase the amount of visual information captured and to
render this information useful. In 2012 his group built the world's first
gigapixel camera, his work today focuses on making gigapixel media and
interactive virtual reality broadcasting ubiquitous.
