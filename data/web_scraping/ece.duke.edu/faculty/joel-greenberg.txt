## Education

  * Ph.D. Duke University, 2012

## Research Interests

Computational sensing with a focus on novel, physics-based measurement
techniques for practical applications. Primarily focused in the
electromagnetic/optical spectrum ranging from ELF through visible and hard
X-rays, with applications to security, non-destructive testing, and medical
imaging. Investigations range from basic science (e.g. fundamental studies in
material science, optics, and information science) to applied and transitional
work (e.g. design and implementation of architectures at the system level
targeted at particular, real-world problems)
