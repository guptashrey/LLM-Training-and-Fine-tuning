Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering

Stacy Tantum received the B.S.E.E. degree in Electrical Engineering and
Economics from Tufts University, Medford, MA, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees in Electrical Engineering, both from Duke University, Durham, NC, in
1996 and 1998, respectively. She was a Summer Research Assistant at SACLANT
Undersea Research Center in La Spezia, Italy in 1996.  
  
Her current research interests include statistical signal processing with
application to remote sensing and ocean acoustics.
