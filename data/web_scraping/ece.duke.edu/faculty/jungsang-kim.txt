Schiciano Family Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer
Engineering

Jungsang Kim leads the Multifunctional Integrated Systems Technology group at
Duke University. His main area of current research is quantum information
sciences, where his group uses trapped atomic ions and a range of photonics
technologies in an effort to construct a scalable quantum information
processors and quantum communication networks. His research focuses on
introduction of new technologies, such as micro fabricated ion traps, optical
micro-electromechanical systems, advanced single photon detectors, compact
cryogenics and vacuum technologies, towards a functional integration of
quantum information processing systems.
