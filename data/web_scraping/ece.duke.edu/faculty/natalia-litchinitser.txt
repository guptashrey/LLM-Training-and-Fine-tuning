Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Litchinitser holds a Ph.D. Electrical Engineering from the Illinois Institute
of Technology. Her primary focus is on metamaterials that manipulate the
visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Litchinitser began her work
with metamaterials as a research scientist at the University of Michigan, and
joined the faculty at the University of Buffalo in 2008. Over the next decade,
she became one of the leading experts in optical metamaterials. Currently,
Litchinitser’s research focuses on topological photonics, which seek to direct
light around tight corners using tiny waveguides that prevent photons from
scattering. She is Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), a Fellow of
the Optical Society of America (OSA), and a Senior Member of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
