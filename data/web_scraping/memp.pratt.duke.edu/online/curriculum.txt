### Extending the Program and Other Options

Students may take courses in any order and may extend the program beyond two
years

Our staff is committed to supporting Duke MEM Online students throughout their
course of study.

We encourage all students to discuss personal programming challenges to
provide options to ensure a successful and meaningful experience. In addition,
we allow online students to extend the program on a case-by-case basis.

Below are two examples of scenarios that would allow a student to complete the
program in more than two years. Note: The student must have completed three
courses to complete the Mid-Program Residency at Duke.

Note well: Not all courses are offered every semester. The student in these
examples should meet with their advisor and must plan carefully.

#### Completing in 3 Years

_In this example, a student doubles up on courses in the final year—but this
can be completed in any semester._

First Year **Orientation Residency at Duke (one week)**  
EGRMGMT 510 Marketing EGRMGMT 520 IP Law
