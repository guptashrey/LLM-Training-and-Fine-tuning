# Michael King

Class Year:

2018

Job Title / Company:

Mechanical Engineer / Cisco Systems

 **Briefly describe your d-MEMP experience, including the impact on your
career.**

d-MEMP helped me understand more of the business side of my job. I'm still in
my same role, but I do feel like my management team values my degree and sees
me as someone with potential to move into a leadership position because of it.

**How did the program's flexibility suit your needs? How were you able to
manage the program with your work/home life?**

I couldn't have done it without the flexibility. Being able to
start/stop/pause the lectures was critical to breaking them up into smaller
chunks to watch them. Most of my professors were extremely helpful online and
very responsive.

For me, I ended up just getting up around 4:30 in the morning to watch the
lectures and work on the assignments. You need to figure out how to find an
additional 15-20 hours in your week, so wherever you can find it works for
you. That's why the flexibility is so great.

**What advice would you give to prospective applicants?**

Make sure you watch the lectures consistently, don't skip weeks and put them
off. I heard people would do that and it would be impossible to watch them all
in one weekend.

Engage with your classmates/professors. They're both extremely valuable in
making it through the program successfully and will help you get more out of
it and enjoy your time.
