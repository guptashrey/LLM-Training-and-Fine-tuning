# Tiera Fletcher

Class Year:

2021

Job Title / Company:

Aerospace Engineer / Boeing

Why did you choose to enroll in the Duke MEM program?

My husband and fellow aerospace engineer, Myron Fletcher, earned a Master of
Engineering Management degree from Duke in 2017. He raved about the program so
much, I had to check it out. The Duke MEM program is one of the top
engineering management master's programs in the country and after undergoing
the program myself, I now know why.

As a working professional, how did the program fit your work and life?

Duke MEM Online is structured perfectly for full-time working professionals.
In my Duke experience, I learned so much in two years that would have taken me
many years to acquire through my career alone.

What career aspirations do you hope the Duke MEM program will help you
achieve?

As an aerospace engineer currently, I aspire to transition into management in
the next step of my career. With the tools that I have acquired through the
program, I am sure that the Duke MEM program will help me achieve that goal.

What was your favorite part of your Duke experience?

My favorite part was interacting with the amazing students in my cohort. They
carried so many different professional talents and perspectives that
contributed to the learning experiences in all courses that I took.
