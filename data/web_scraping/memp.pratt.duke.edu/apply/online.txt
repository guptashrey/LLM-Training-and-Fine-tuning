#### About Admission Rounds

Which round is best? That's up to you. Duke uses rounds to manage the flow of
applications and to provide timely admission decisions. However, we consider
every application, no matter which round it's in. So, it would be best if you
chose the round with dates that fit your timeline. When making your selection,
keep in mind:

  * If you are applying to other degree programs and you're concerned about
    responding to multiple offers, consider the date by which a reply is
    required
  * If you are applying to Duke MEM Online and want to include your education
    plans in your performance review, consider the decision notification date

#### Important Notes About Deadlines

  * To be considered in an application round, your application must be
    complete by the deadline
  * Send your scores to Duke at least one (1) month before the deadline you
    seek
  * Ask your recommendation providers to submit their information by the
    deadline
  * In some cases, Duke may postpone a decision to the next round
  * Duke can only guarantee a spot for admitted applicants until the date by
    which a reply is required
  * Admitted students may request to defer admission to a future term—contact
    Duke for more information

#### Advice for All Applicants

  * Think of submitting your online application as the same as sealing and
    mailing an envelope
  * Once you have submitted your application, none of its documents can be
    altered
  * Please take care to proofread carefully
