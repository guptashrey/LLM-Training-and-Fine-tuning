# Alumni News: Sharma Lauded for Volunteerism

August 12, 2013

MEM Alum Ish Sharma, Class of 2008, was recently honored as the Durham Herald-
Sun's Volunteer of the Week for his efforts at Duke University Medical Center.
From the article:

"Ish Sharma is a dedicated volunteer and volunteer trainer in the Emergency
Room of Duke University Medical Center every Saturday morning. Without
volunteers like Ish, the Emergency Room would be a much more chaotic place. In
this stressful environment, Ish provides calmness with his warm spirit and
compassionate ear.

Working with staff, patients and their families, Ish is always a comforting
personality. He is a true advocate for the patient and shares that talent with
other volunteers. A wonderful trainer for new volunteers, Ish helps them
understand their roles, feel more comfortable in those roles and know how to
best help those in the emergency room.

Thank you, Ish Sharma, for your devotion to patients, staff and volunteers.
You help make the Emergency Room at Duke one of the best!"
