# Pravar Among Annual Leaders in Excellence at Citi

January 15, 2015

Pravar symbolizes the leadership, commitment, passion, and dedication towards
excellence that we strive to instill in our MEM students.

Pravar Vijayvargya, MEM ’11 , was awarded Citigroup’s 2014 Annual Leaders in
Excellence Award, an accolade conferred to only the top 1% of employees who
exhibit outstanding leadership. Pravar symbolizes the leadership, commitment,
passion, and dedication towards excellence that we strive to instill in our
MEM students.

While pursuing his MEM degree at Duke, Pravar interned as a Summer Analyst
with JPMorgan Chase in their Investment Banking middle office. He also
interned as a Business Analyst with an eco-friendly wood pellet startup firm,
where he conducted market research and created valuation of the company and a
business plan. While in the program, Pravar was actively involved with student
groups like the MEM Consulting Club as a Social Media Chair and with the MEM
Finance club. He strongly believes that the coursework, seminars, and co-
curricular activities at MEM Program at Duke helped him to develop
quantitative, qualitative and team-building skills that prepared him for the
industry.

After graduating from Duke’s MEM program, Pravar joined CGN & Associates as a
Business Consultant. He later joined Citi as Credit & Portfolio Assistant
Manager where he was involved in building credit and portfolio strategies. As
a part of acquisition team he developed a strong understanding of defining and
tracking credit risk for different products.

Congratulations, Pravar!
