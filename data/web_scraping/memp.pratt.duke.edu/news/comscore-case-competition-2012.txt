# comScore Case Competition 2012

November 1, 2012

In early October, 52 students, including 29 Master of Engineering Management
students, competed in the first comScore, Inc. Case Competition at Duke
University. This event, which began on Friday, October 5th with ten teams,
continued for the next 60 hours, culminating in five teams selected to present
during the finals on the following Monday morning.

Teams were asked to develop strategies to address an issue that marketers face
every day: “How do you quantify media exposures and their impact on
consumers?” Final presentations consisted of teams providing unique
perspectives on this question using algorithms, behavioral psychology,
marketing techniques, and a host of other methods. Decisions were made by a
judge’s panel consisting of Andrew Lipsman, VP of Marketing & Industry
Analysis at comScore, Jonathan Zile, Director of Media Solutions at comScore,
and Dr. Greg Hopper, a Duke adjunct faculty member and Sr. Product Manager at
NetApp.

The winning team consisted of Dai Li (MEMP), Harsha Ravi (MEMP), Xuan Zhang
(MEMP), Andrea Pappas (PhD), and Tianxiang Xiong (BS). They were awarded
second round interviews with comScore, Inc. in Reston, VA and a gift card.

The second place team consisted of Rakhee Raj Bharamaraj (MEMP), Anirudh
Nellutla (MEMP), Shambhavi Vashishtha (MEMP), Inderpreet Jalli (PhD), and
Grant Wang (PhD) and were awarded a first round interview with comScore, Inc.
and a gift card.

Thank you to Anubhav Mehrotra (MEMP '11) and Aman Sethi (MEMP '10) who
coordinated the competition and served as judges of the initial submissions!
