# Duke and Navy Agree to Enroll Nuclear-Trained Naval Officers in Master of
Eng. Management Program

February 15, 2005

Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering and the U.S. Naval Nuclear
Propulsion Program have agreed to establish a partnership that will enable
nuclear-trained Navy officers to enroll in Pratt's Master of Engineering
Management degree program.

The agreement signed February 9 formalizes a cooperative effort that began
last semester. Two Navy officers are now students in the Master of Engineering
Program, which integrates engineering and business principles to develop
future leaders of technology-based organizations.

Under the agreement signed by Pratt Dean Kristina M. Johnson and Thomas H.
Beckett, deputy director of Naval Reactors, Navy students will receive a
partial fellowship from Pratt and advanced standing for prior Navy work for up
to 12 credits.

"There is tremendous strategic advantage for the Navy to have people with
technical degrees in our leadership ranks," Beckett said. "This partnership
creates a beautiful mix of technical and business skills that will form the
future leadership of the Navy."

Added Johnson, "This strategic alliance is an excellent fit for the Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program and the Pratt School of Engineering because both
are committed to advanced educational opportunities to train and develop
future leaders. Both Pratt and the Navy understand the critical role of
leadership and technology to be successful in today's world. The Master of
Engineering Management Program mission is equally applicable to military
leaders and leaders in the corporate world."
