# Alumni Admissions Ambassadors Program 2013

December 20, 2012

###

### Calling all MEM Alumni!

The Master of Engineering Management Program invites you to participate in its
**Alumni Admissions Ambassadors Program**.

Now in its sixth year, the program allows alumni to take part in the
admissions process by serving as an additional resource for select newly
admitted students.

Participating alums are matched to admitted students based upon undergraduate
institution, major, or industry of interest. Alumni make first contact, and
admitted students reply with questions to learn about the program from a
former student’s point of view.

Last year, participating alums contacted almost 200 admitted students, and
over half of those contacted joined the MEM program in the fall. You make a
huge difference, and we hope to contact even more this year!

For further information, view our volunteer information or contact Susan
Brown.

To participate in Round 1, sign up by Friday, February 15 [registration
closed]. If you miss this deadline, don't worry - those who sign up after this
date will be assigned candidates from Rounds 2 and 3.
