# Turning Grand Challenges into Grand Opportunities

May 13, 2014

A team of engineering students in the Master of Engineering and Master of
Engineering Management programs participated in an independent study that
explored ways to meet Grand Challenges. Read the Forbes article.

"The project sought to explore how aspiring entrepreneurs can be inspired to
develop market-based solutions to real world problems using cheap and
accessible technologies like smartphones, the mobile internet and sensors."
said Professor Vivek Wadhwa, who led the independent study.

## ideasX : Turning Grand Challenges into Grand Opportunities

ideasX is a concept for an online platform for discussing ideas for
technology-based solutions that would address problems in the developing
world. The hypothesis is simple - in order to be able to do this, you need to
create a conducive environment for people having diverse and complementary
skillsets to come together and brainstorm over a problem. The goal is to work
with domain experts - people and organizations who have spent a lot of time
studying specific real world problems widely categorized under the 6 'Grand
Challenges' of Global Health, Food, Water, Energy, Environment and Education,
to identify problems that can be solved by mobile technologies and cheap
sensor-based devices interfaced with mobile phones. These problems are then
used as discussion topics on the website, where people having expertise in
areas such as engineering, business, design or medicine can contribute. The
goal of each discussion is to generate at least one idea for solving the
problem.

The team include MEng student Aditya Murthy and MEM students Samkit Shah and
Pranav Deshpande.
