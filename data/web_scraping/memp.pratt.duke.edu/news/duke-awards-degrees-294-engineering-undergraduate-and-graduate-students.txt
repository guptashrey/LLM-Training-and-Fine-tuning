# Duke Awards Degrees to 294 Engineering Undergraduate and Graduate Students

May 10, 2004

Duke University and its Pratt School of Engineering awarded degrees to 294
undergraduate and graduate students Sunday in a series of ceremonies beginning
with a university-wide commencement exercise in Wallace Wade Stadium and
winding up with a rousing ceremony in Duke Chapel.

A total of 235 students, including 13 who completed their work in December and
six last September, received Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees from
Dean Kristina M. Johnson before a standing-room-only crowd of parents,
relatives and friends in Duke Chapel.

In addition, Pratt awarded 24 Master of Engineering Management degrees. The
university's Graduate School awarded three Master of Science degrees and seven
Doctor of Philosophy degrees to graduate students in biomedical engineering;
one MS and one PhD to civil and environmental engineering students; 13 MS and
eight PhDs to students in electrical and computer engineering; and two PhDs in
mechanical engineering and materials science.

The diploma ceremony for the Master of Engineering Management Program, which
began in 1997, was held at noon in the Teer Building. The Graduate School
ceremony was held at noon in Page Auditorium and the undergraduate ceremony
began a half hour later in the Chapel.

"The Class of 2004 is truly remarkable," Johnson said, recounting the numerous
team and individual awards and honors won by members of the class.

"I have a deep and personal affection for the Class of 2004. This is the first
class I helped recruit to Duke," said Johnson, who was appointed dean in 1999.
"I will not forget you....I wish you the very best on the road to your journey
ahead."

Aruna Venkatesan, who is from Pleasanton, California, was awarded the Walter
J. Seeley Scholastic Award by Johnson for achieving the highest grade point
average in all subjects among members of her class. This award is sponsored by
the Engineering Student Government.
