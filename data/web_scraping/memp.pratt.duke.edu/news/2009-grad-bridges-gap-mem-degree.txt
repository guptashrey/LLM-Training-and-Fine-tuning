# 2009 Grad "Bridges the Gap" with MEM degree

May 21, 2013

Brad Pantuck, MEM 2009, has published an article, "Bridging the Gap," in the
May/June issue of Defense AT&L Magazine. In it Pantuck asserts that it's best
for government R&D managers to set a short timeline (2-3 years) for new
technology delivery and establish firm agreements among developers, end users,
and operational stakeholders at project inception.

Brad writes:

"I continue to extract value from my Duke MEM education, and I continue to
think of myself as a 'T-shaped individual,' working at the junction of
engineering and business/management. I appreciate the tutelage and mentoring I
received during my time in MEM."

A graduate of the University of Virginia in Mechanical Engineering, Brad
graduated from Duke with his Master of Engineering Management degree in 2009.
He focused on the commercialization of technology, studing the management of
technology, R&D organizational structures, prototyping, intellectual property
strategy, and technology entrepreneurism. As the capstone of his studies, he
and an interdisciplinary team of students were Finalists in the 2009 Duke
Start-Up Challenge with a business plan for a vaccine company based on Duke
Hospital intellectual property. He now serves as Technology
Transition/Transfer Manager at Research Analysis and Engineering, LLC.
