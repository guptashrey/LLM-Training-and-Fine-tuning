# Duke's Brad Fox Elected to IEEE Engineering Management Society's Board of
Governors

October 13, 2005

Brad Fox, executive director of the Master of Engineering Management Program
at Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering, has been elected to the IEEE
Engineering Management Society’s Board of Governors. Fox will serve a three-
year term, beginning January 1.

“Brad Fox’s appointment to the EMS Board of Governors is an opportunity to
advance engineering management and is recognition of his credentials the
stature and quality of Duke’s Master of Engineering Management program,” said
Jeff Glass, Hogg Family Director of Engineering Management and
Entrepreneurship. “Brad’s participation on the board will even more strongly
connect our educational program to an influential professional community.”

Fox said one of his goals as a Board of Governors member is to increase
awareness of engineering management as a discipline. He also plans to advocate
engineering management tools and techniques, and foster such practices as a
means of continuous career development.

“I recently made a career change and left the corporate world to join Duke
University's Master of Engineering Management Program,” said Fox, who came to
Duke in 2004 from GE Consumer Products in Cleveland, Ohio. “I made this change
to better prepare engineers for careers as engineering managers and leaders.”

Fox gained engineering management experience at GE Consumer Products, Kobe
Steel USA, Inc., and IBM Burlington. He has a PhD in materials science from
the University of Virginia, and a BS in materials engineering from the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
