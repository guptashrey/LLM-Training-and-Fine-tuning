# Johnson Awarded for Work in Career Services

May 23, 2014

Jenny Johnson, MEMP’s Assistant Director of Career Services, was recently
recognized with two professional awards highlighting her achievements in
career services.

Earlier this year, Jenny was selected to receive a **2014 Rising Star Award
from the American College Personnel Association**. The award recognizes one
individual who has demonstrated strong leadership potential and contributions
to the career services profession and/or to the ACPA Commission for Career
Development.

Jenny was also recently recognized as the recipient of the **2014 Furney K.
James Outstanding Service award at the North Carolina Association of Colleges
and Employers** ( **NCACE) conference**. The award recognizes high levels of
impact (i.e. significant contribution through participation on committees,
demonstrated leadership, and/or development of a new program) rendered to
NCACE by a member or former member of the association.

Congratulations, Jenny!
