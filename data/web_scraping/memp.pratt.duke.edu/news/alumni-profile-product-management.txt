# Alumni Profile: Product Management

August 1, 2013

## Kristina Larson Tracy, MEM ‘08

Duke MEMP Alum Kristina Larson Tracy (08’) is currently a Product Manager at
the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The Broad is a highly collaborative
non-profit biomedical and research center whose goal is tackling complex
problems and transforming medicine by better understanding and treating
disease. Kristina’s work entails managing the RNA Sequencing and Expression
projects that go through the Genomics Platform. Her role requires her to keep
things moving in the pipeline as well as to ensure projects are completed on
time and within budget.

Kristina believes that her experience at Duke has been instrumental in her
success. The MEMP courses she took in Management, Finance, and Project
Management have been contributory to her work at the Broad Institute. With
these courses she learned how to understand and work with a team setting, deal
with conflicts that can arise within the team, and develop people management
skills, all of which is a part of her everyday work. For Kristina, the biggest
takeaway from her time in the MEMP is the understanding it gave her for
working in the business world and also learning how to better interact with
and manage a diverse set of people.

Kristina’s favorite MEMory was the exposure she got to industry leaders during
the weekly Friday seminars. The networking opportunities that came with the
MEM Program proved to be extremely beneficial to her as well.
