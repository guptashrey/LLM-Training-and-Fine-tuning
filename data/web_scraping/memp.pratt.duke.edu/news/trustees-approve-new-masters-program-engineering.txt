# Trustees approve new master’s program in engineering

February 27, 2010

DURHAM, N.C. -- The Duke University Board of Trustees on Saturday approved a
new 18-month Master of Engineering Degree that is designed to provide students
with the skills to contribute effectively to the technical needs of a global
organization immediately upon graduation. The program will launch in the fall.

While encompassing some of the same subject areas offered in a traditional
M.S. program, the Duke M.Eng. will be a practice-oriented professional degree
that includes the study of core business fundamentals and principles of
leadership and management. Students will be expected to do an internship,
project or equivalent undertaking that enhances their understanding of
organizations.

“We anticipate that most M.Eng. students will work in industry following
graduation rather than continuing on for doctoral studies in science and
engineering research,” said Pratt Dean Thomas Katsouleas. “The new degree will
position the Pratt School of Engineering as a leader in developing
professional master’s curricula that deliver state-of-the-art technical depth
coupled with necessary business knowledge breadth to produce graduates who can
truly impact their organizations.”

Pratt developed the program partly in response to a 2008 National Research
Council study that found an overwhelming need for master’s level professional
education, Katsouleas noted.

The program development is being led by Jeff Glass, senior associate dean for
education at Pratt.
