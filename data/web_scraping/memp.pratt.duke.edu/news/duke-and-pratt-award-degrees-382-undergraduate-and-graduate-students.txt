# Duke and Pratt Award Degrees to 382 Undergraduate and Graduate Students

June 1, 2007

Duke University and its Pratt School of Engineering awarded degrees to 382
undergraduate and graduate students May 13, and Dean Kristina M. Johnson told
Pratt's Class of 2007 and their families and friends at a Chapel celebration
that "It's a perfect time to be an engineer."

Johnson awarded Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees to 212 students,
including eight who completed their work in December and six last September,
before a crowd of students, parents, friends and relatives in Duke Chapel, and
an Internet audience watching the ceremonies on the web.

Pratt also awarded 77 Master of Engineering Management degrees, and the
university's Graduate School awarded Doctor of Philosophy degrees to 42
engineers who completed their work in 2006-07, and 51 Master of Science
degrees to Pratt engineers.

Three graduating seniors won Pratt's Walter J. Seeley Scholastic Award, which
is given by the Engineering Student Government to the student who has achieved
the highest scholastic average in all subjects. The award, given for the first
time to three students who had perfect 4.0 grade point averages, went to
Meredith Brooke Cantrell, Amy Rachel Motomura and Noah K. K. Sakimura.

Duke's university-wide commencement ceremonies began at 10 a.m. in Wallace
Wade Stadium. University President Richard H. Brodhead presided and General
Motors Chairman Rick Wagoner, a 1975 graduate of Duke and member of the
university's board of trustees, delivered the commencement address.

In Pratt's hour-long afternoon ceremony in the Chapel, Johnson said the major
challenges facing the world today are not much different from those that
existed when she graduated from college 26 years ago. There was an energy
crisis, a hostage crisis, growing concern about jobs migrating offshore and
there was a newly observed hole in the ozone layer shielding Earth from
harmful radiation. Since then, the United States has increased its dependence
on foreign oil, and terrorism has escalated. Johnson said most people believe
that changes in the global climate are heavily influenced by human behavior.
And manufacturing and engineering jobs as well as research and development are
being outsourced.

"The issues are similar, they just seem more complex and acute," Johnson said.
"What made this country great is the ability to engineer and create new
products, technologies and companies that even a few years ago were
unimaginable. Have we lost our inventive talent, spirit and will? Hardly."

Consider this, she said: Since the Class of 2007 has been at Duke, Apple
opened its first iPod store, and last month the company sold its 100 millionth
iPod. Facebook was founded in the students' freshmen year. Today is it is the
No. 1 Internet site for digital pictures. Google went public in their
sophomore year. Today it dominates its field because Google engineers
developed the world's best Internet search engine technology, she said.
YouTube also was founded in their sophomore year and last year its three young
developers sold it to Google for $1.67 billion.

"It's a perfect time to be an engineer – the pace of innovation is
accelerating and exhilarating, and survival will go to those who invent or
reinvent themselves utilizing superior technology. So what's next?"

"The engineer of the future will need to be a good steward of the planet and
work globally to address behavioral and cultural challenges such as equitable
access to energy and water, while being mindful of the need to conserve,
remediate and preserve our environment," Johnson told the new engineers. "We
are at a tipping point – and you have the power and knowledge to tip us in the
right direction."

In a second address, Pratt Senior Class President Benjamin Schaefer Abram
complemented Johnson's comments.

"Our generation has graduated to a wave of crises," Abram said. "Everywhere
you look there are monumental energy, environmental and public health dilemmas
that beg for solutions. … We, the engineers of the 21st century, will require
wisdom and sophistication to solve the problem sets that we'll face after
today. … Pratt and Duke have prepared us well."
