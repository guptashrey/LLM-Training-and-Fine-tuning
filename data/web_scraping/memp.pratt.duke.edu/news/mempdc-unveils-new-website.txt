# MEMPDC Unveils New Website

March 26, 2013

The Master of Engineering Management Program Development Committee is a
student-run organization whose members work with the program's administration
to plan student activities, coordinate student recruitment events, and enhance
industry relations. Their new website keeps students up to date on the latest
activities and resources.

The new and improved MEMPDC Website is finally out!

The anticipation can come to an end! After weeks of hard work, dedication and
a number of brainstorming sessions, the Communications Committee has finally
put together the MEM Program Development Committee Website. Take a look at it
right now at http://sites.duke.edu/mempdc!

The website contains live feeds of the Duke MEMP web page, descriptions and
workings of the different committees of the PDC, i.e. the Student Recruiting
Committee, the Career Development and Alumni Relations Committee, the Student
Activities Committee and the Creative Communications Committee. We have
interesting blogs by MEMP students, video interviews of our beloved professors
and coverage of certain seminars that MEM students have learned a lot from!
You can also find the contact information of all the PDC Directors and get in
touch with them for any concern or questions. Find out what events are taking
place within the Duke MEM Program and add them to your calendar by clicking on
the Events tab. Finally, walk down MEMory lane and see what MEMers have been
up to by checking out the MEMORIES section.

A special shout out to the CCC members Ashwath Muralidharan and Aditya
Bandikallu for helping out the most with this project!

**Sanjana Udupa**  
Director, Communications Committee
