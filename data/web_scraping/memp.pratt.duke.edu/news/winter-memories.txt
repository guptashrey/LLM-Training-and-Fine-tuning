# Winter MEMories

January 9, 2009

The fall semester was extremely busy for MEM students. Somewhere between
building a roller coaster for Dr. Fox's project management class, sampling the
finest cuisine that the world has to offer at the International Food Fest, and
sorting through page upon page of corporate finance cases for Professor
Skender, the semester came and went.

Many students who weren't leaving Durham for the winter break had a lot of
free time on their hands after the dust settled in the fall term. The MEM
program opted to set up some winter fun for these folks and found it hard to
resist joining in!

There were several screenings of various movies and shows in the MEM student
room. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and season one of Flight of the Conchords were
all well attended. There were also several afternoons of game playing with Uno
Attack quickly emerging as an MEM favorite. There was also a Trivial Pursuit
tournament which was won commandingly by Vekram Jenarthanan. Additionally,
there was a side trip to the Nasher Museum of Art and a visit from MEM staffer
Susan Brown's baby, Jack.

Perhaps the most delightful event of this week of frosty cheer was a winter
hike through the Duke Forest. We spent an afternoon appreciating the trees and
the birds and all of the wonderful things that nature has to offer that we
never seem to have enough time to enjoy. We didn't see any lions, tigers, or
bears, but we did laugh a lot and surely this hike will be a sweet MEMory for
each of us.
