Hi-G-Tek, a leading developer and provider of radio frequency ID (RFID)
solutions for high-value assets and sensitive materials, has assembled an
executive team with decades of combined management experience and an
impressive list of advanced technology expertise to its credit.

Larry A. Blue who was appointed the new President and Chief Executive Officer
of Hi-G-Tek, has assembled a U.S. executive team that combines seasoned
veterans, with entrepreneurial company builders who have taken former start-
ups and taught them how to scale for long-term success. Blue has nearly 30
years' management experience with radio frequency (RF) and microprocessor
technology.

Mr. Blue earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Duke
University and holds two U.S. patents.

Most recently, Blue was Vice President and General Manager of the RFID Tag
Sector of Symbol Technologies (formerly Matrics, Inc.). From 2004 through
early 2006, he directed that unit's growth from $4 million to $30 million
plus.

"Hi-G-Tek is enjoying an unprecedented growth spurt," Blue said in a
statement. "With the recent $10 million capital infusion we received, we are
able to move full speed ahead to pursue our core applications of RFID
technology in our primary markets."

The two venture-capital firms that have financed Hi-G-Tek, Inc. are Battelle
Ventures, L.P. and L Capital Partners.

Blue added that Hi-G-Tek has just launched several promising initiatives to
highlight the company's leading-edge technological innovations.

"The biggest key to our next phase of growth is the technical competence and
capable leadership of our new management team," he said.
