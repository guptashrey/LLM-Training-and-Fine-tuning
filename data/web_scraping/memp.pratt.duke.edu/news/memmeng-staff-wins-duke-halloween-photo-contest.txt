# MEM/MEng Staff Wins Duke Halloween Photo Contest

November 7, 2014

Duke Engineering’s staff dominoes lined up 333 votes to win the grand prize in
the 4th annual Working@Duke Blue Devil Halloween Photo Contest.

The photo of Duke Engineering Professional Masters Programs staffers dressed
in black clothes with white Styrofoam dots and lined up on the floor as
dominoes took an early lead in this season’s contest, which drew 41 photo
submissions from individuals and teams across Duke.

Staci Thornton, the Duke Engineering Professional Masters Programs academic
coordinator who submitted the winning photo, said she and her officemates
started preparing for the Halloween contest after they received second place
last year for their Star Trek group photo. They garnered the most votes this
year by sharing their submission with friends, family and students.

The Duke Engineering group will receive coffee mugs decorated with the team’s
winning contest photo.

“We’re a very close-knit staff and we take it very seriously,” Thornton said.
“It’s definitely something we’re all proud of.”
