# Duke MEMP Team Takes on Supply Chain Finance Academy Global Student
Challenge

May 11, 2017

A team of Duke MEMP students (Fajar Prihantoro, Nattakarn Tientrakul, Ping Yao
Goh, and Sachin Londhe) took part in the Global Student Challenge powered by
Supply Chain Finance Academy.

A team of Duke MEMP students (Fajar Prihantoro, Nattakarn Tientrakul, Ping Yao
Goh, and Sachin Londhe) took part in the Global Student Challenge powered by
Supply Chain Finance Academy. The Global Student Challenge is an annual online
business simulation in the supply chain finance area. This year, over 200
universities participated from around the world. The Duke MEMP team passed 3
preliminary rounds to eventually qualify for the USA Regional Final held in
the Center for Global Supply Chain Management, University of Southern
California, Los Angeles on March 9.

14 teams, including students from Arizona State University, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, California State Polytechnic University, Duke University, University
of Maryland (Robert H. Smith School of Business), University of Southern
California (Marshall School of Business), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,
Washington University in St. Louis, and other schools, were invited to the
2017 USA Regional Final. The winner of the Regional Final was then invited to
the Global Final held in Amsterdam, Netherlands to compete for prizes worth
20,000 Euros. Unfortunately, the Duke MEMP team did not qualify for the Global
Final, however, it was an enriching experience for them as they managed to
apply theoretical supply chain finance knowledge in a practical simulation and
meet with fellow supply chain finance enthusiasts from other universities!
