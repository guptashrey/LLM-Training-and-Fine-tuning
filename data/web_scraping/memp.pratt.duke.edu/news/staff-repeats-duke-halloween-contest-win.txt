# Staff Repeats Duke Halloween Contest Win

November 6, 2015

Taking a cue from the popular board game, Guess Who?, staff from the Pratt
School of Engineering’s Professional Masters Programs posed as the game’s
characters

Guess who won Working@Duke’s 5th annual Blue Devil Halloween photo contest?

Taking a cue from the popular board game, Guess Who?, 11 staff from the Pratt
School of Engineering’s Professional Masters Programs posed as the game’s
characters, complete with frames to place around each of their faces. Despite
the theme, plenty of people knew who they wanted to vote for, as the photo
tallied 522 votes to win the grand prize in the contest.

The idea was thought up by Vigor Lam and Lorelle Babwah, who decided to stick
to a theme of games after the department captured the top spot in last year’s
contest by dressing up and posing as a game of dominos. Thirteen staff members
dressed up as Guess Who? characters, each making matching T-shirts and laser
cut wooden frames with names on them.

“Our group is big, so it can be hard to find costumes for a lot of people, but
we all really cared about it,” said Babwah, student services coordinator for
Professional Masters Programs.

As the grand prize winner, the group will receive coffee mugs decorated with
the team’s wining contest photo. To view all of the submissions to this year’s
Blue Devil Halloween Photo Contest, visit the Working@Duke Facebook photo
album.
