# MEM Alumni Video Project - Join Today!

November 12, 2013

The MEMP Student Recruitment Committee (a subcommittee of the MEMP Development
Committee) is in the process of preparing promotional videos for prospective
students. Project Lead Jin Min Ong invites you to participate in this
initiative by creating a short video (3 - 4 minutes) of your home country
(culture, food, people, interesting places).

MEMP is proud to have students with various backgrounds and this is a good
opportunity to display the diversity of MEMP! Below is an example by our
Icelandic alumni from a few years ago:

Our committee members will compile all the videos and promote them on MEMP
website/Facebook page. Please contact Jie Min if you are willing to
participate, so that she can provide you with further information. The
deadline for submissions is January 18.

Thank you!
