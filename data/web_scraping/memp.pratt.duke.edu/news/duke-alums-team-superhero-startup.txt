# Duke Alums team up for Superhero Startup

December 12, 2015

Jaineel Aga, MEMP '09, and Sumit Shah, Fuqua '12, teamed up to create a
superhero merchandising startup that has raised about $500,000 in Pre-Series A
Funding

Jaineel Aga, MEMP '09, and Sumit Shah, Fuqua '12, have teamed up to create a
superhero merchandising startup that has raised about $500,000 in its Pre-
Series A Funding round.

The alumni, along with University of Oxford graduate Karan Rai, founded Planet
Superheroes in 2013 as a licensed merchandising site dedicated to official
superhero, comic, and TV show characters from Marvel, Warner Bros, Fox,
Universal, and Cartoon Network. The funding will allow the company to expand
its product portfolio, further build its distribution network, and widen its
presence through online and offline channels.

"The global retail merchandise market is a $50 billion opportunity, and we
haven't even begun to scratch the surface here. We will be expanding online as
well through traditional retail channels, going forward," said Aga, who was
previously with Baring Private Equity Asia.

"It's good to be putting those engineering management skills of Supply Chain
in practice," Aga continued. "You won't believe it, but I do rigorously
implement the "Stop, Start, Continue" framework."
