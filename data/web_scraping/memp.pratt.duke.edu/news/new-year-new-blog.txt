# A New Year, a New Blog

January 8, 2014

Keep in touch with Duke's MEM Program through the new Pratt Professional
Masters Program blog! The goal of this blog is to share information regarding
the Master of Engineering Management (MEM) and Master of Engineering (MEng)
programs. Posts include profiles on faculty and alumni, industry news, program
information, and content reflecting admissions, student life, academics and
career services. All posts are organized by “tags” to assist you in finding
the information important to you.

Assistant Director of Career Services Ross Wade says, "We're so excited about
sharing this blog. It's a great way to stay engaged with current students,
applicants, and alumni and let them know what's going on with our programs!"
