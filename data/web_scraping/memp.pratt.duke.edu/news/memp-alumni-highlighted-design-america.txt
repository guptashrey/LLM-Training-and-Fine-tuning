Ahsaan Rizvi, MEMP 2014, was recently featured as one of Design for America's
alumni around the world who continue to make impact even after graduation,
taking initiative to share their knowledge and experiences with the DFA
network and beyond.

This post originally appear on the Celebrating #DFAlumni page.

Ahsaan Rizvi attended Duke University on a Fulbright scholarship, where he
joined DFA Duke and learned to use his mechanical engineering background for
social good. After graduation, Ahsaan began to recognize the socially-minded
people around him and created Design for Pakistan, amplifying the DFA spirit
globally. So far he’s recruited other talented leaders and together they have
led many human-centered design workshops at universities in Islamabad. We’re
excited to see what’s next!
