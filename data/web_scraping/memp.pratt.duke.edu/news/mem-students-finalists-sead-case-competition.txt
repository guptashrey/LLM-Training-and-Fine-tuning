# MEM Students Finalists in SEAD Case Competition

April 9, 2014

A team of MEM Students were among the finalists in a recent case competition
organized by SEAD (Social Entrepreneurship Accelerator at Duke).

Competing against interdisciplinary teams from all over Duke, the team worked
as consultants for a Kenyan micro-health insurance provider, Changamka
Microhealth Ltd. Their challenge was to find innovative ways to make the
company's latest health insurance product 'Linda Jamii', a comprehensive
policy which included coverage for maternity, dental and optical care, more
accessible to people in Kenya.

The team included Manu Mohan, Sachin Solomon, Junwen Zhang, Sudha Karthigeyan,
and Joshua Smith (pictured above). Congratulations, MEMers!
