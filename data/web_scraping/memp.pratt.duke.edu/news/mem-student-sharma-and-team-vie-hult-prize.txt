# MEM Student Sharma and Team Vie for Hult Prize

February 20, 2017

An MEM student is headed to San Francisco to take part in a regional
competition for the Hult Prize, one of the world's top social entrepreneurship
prizes.

An MEM student is headed to San Francisco to take part in a regional
competition for the Hult Prize, one of the world's top social entrepreneurship
prizes. Shantanu Sharma and three undergraduates bested four other teams in
the second round of judging at Duke to advance directly to the San Francisco
regional competition, which will be held the first weekend of March. There
they will face approximately 60 other teams competing for one of 10 global
finalist spots and one wildcard position.

The Hult Prize is an annual competition that invites teams from universities
to answer a social challenge chosen by former president Bill Clinton. The
contest carries a grand prize of $1 million to implement the idea. This year's
challenge asked, "Can we build sustainable, scalable social enterprises that
restore the rights and dignity of 10 million refugees by 2022?"
