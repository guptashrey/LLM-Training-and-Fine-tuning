Before coming to Duke

I studied Materials Science and Engineering at Imperial College London.

Why I chose Duke’s MEM program

I was looking to transition to a more managerial and business role, hence I
wanted to build a strong business acumen that I could combine with my problem-
solving skills. The program was perfect in that regard and I got to learn
about a lot of different topics of business.

My favorite courses

Competitive Strategies, because it makes you think in depth about what
companies do and why. Also Negotiations and Consultative Sales, because
negotitation is a skill that I will use in every area of my life.

Top places to visit in Durham

Heavenly Buffaloes, Boxcar, and Ponysaurus.

My favorite Duke MEMory

Watching the Duke-UNC games with classmates and celebrating both wins on
campus with the whole university.

My advice to new students

Go explore and get involved! Duke has so many clubs and societies and the
program will go by faster than you think. Get involved in the MEM clubs but
also try to connect with the broader univerisity: go watch football and
basketball games, try club sports, Intramurals, Bass Connections, Duke
Motorsports, Wellness Center programs, etc.
