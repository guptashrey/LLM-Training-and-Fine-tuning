# Tarunam Mahajan

Class Year:

2020

Job Title / Company:

Senior Associate Technology Program Manager / Equinix

  * Previous Education: BS, Electronics and Communication Engineering
  * Hometown: Pathankot, India

Before coming to Duke

I worked for three years at Ericsson as a Network Engineer responsible for
integration and deployment of mobile network for Pan-American markets.

Why I chose Duke MEM

Duke was my No. 1 choice. Duke's MEM Program is highly flexible, and provides
the freedom to pick and choose the coursework that best serves your
professional interests. Coming from an engineering background, I wished to
navigate to the business side of technology and Duke MEM courses could provide
the right exposure to fields like marketing, finance, product and program
management. I wished to explore my interest in multiple disciplines, and saw
myself as a perfect fit for Duke's MEM program.

My favorite courses

My favorite Duke MEM courses were Project Management, Competitive Strategies
and Management in High-Tech Industries. All three are highly structured and
impart industry-relevant skills. I was able to directly implement the
frameworks, concepts and knowledge.

Top places to visit in Durham

  * Blue corn cafe: If you're into Latin American food

  * The shortcake sundae at Goodberry Frozen custard

  * Pour Taproom, Another not-to-miss, right in the heart of downtown Durham

My favorite spot on campus

I have a lot of favorite places on campus, but my favorite is when the bells
in Duke Chapel chime every day at 5 o'clock sharp.

My favorite Duke MEMory

Friday evening MEM seminars, followed by Pratt Chat socials for engineering
graduate students.

After Duke MEM

I joined Equinix, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., as a Senior Associate Program
Manager. I'll be working with the product security team responsible for
helping a cross-functional team manage project schedules, define workflows,
manage resources, and ensure smooth delivery of product features throughout
the lifecycle of any software product.
