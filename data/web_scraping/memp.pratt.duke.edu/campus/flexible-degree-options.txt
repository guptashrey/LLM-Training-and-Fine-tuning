# Flexible Degree Options

Available within the Duke Engineering Management Campus Program

## Program Flexibility

### Part-Time Study

This Duke master's program is available on a part-time basis—about 10 percent
of campus-based students choose this option.

To make scheduling easier for part-time students:

  * We consistently offer late-afternoon class meeting times, for elective
    courses and at least one section of each of four (4) core courses
  * Most courses meet just once per week

Browse course descriptions »  

#### Important Notes

  * If a student does not plan to take any classes for a semester or more, the
    program requires a leave of absence
  * See Duke's semester listings. Our courses are offered under the
    registration symbol EGRMGMT
  * Part-time students apply using our standard application

### Extending the Program Beyond a Year

Though the Duke Master of Engineering Management can be completed in just a
year, students may elect to extend to three (3) semesters. About 60 percent of
international students choose this option.

Please note: There is no evidence that a third semester improves the chances
of employment.

Consider extending if you:

  * Would like to take fewer courses
  * Want to take additional courses ( _Important_ _Note: Courses beyond the
    eight (8) required courses may incur additional tuition_ )

To extend your program, please speak to a program administrator.

#### Example Curriculum: 3 Semesters

Fall 1 Spring Summer Fall 2  
EGRMGMT 530 Finance EGRMGMT 540 Management Internship* Technical Elective 3  
EGRMGMT 510 Marketing EGRMGMT 520 IP, Bus. Law & Entrepreneurship EGRMGMT 550:

Technical Elective 1 Technical Elective 2 EGRMGMT 551: Engineering Management
Internship Assessment  
EGRMGMT 501 MEM Seminar and Workshop Series EGRMGMT 501 MEM Seminar and
Workshop Series  
  
### Non-Degree Student

Those who do not intend to obtain a degree may take courses as non-degree
students.

Non-degree applicants:

  * Should submit an application by June 15
  * Are required to submit all parts of the application, except GRE scores
  * Upon acceptance, may take any course designated EGRMGMT
  * May only apply as many as four (4) EGRMGMT courses toward a future degree

#### Minimum Pre-Requisite Course Requirements

##### Math Courses

  * Calculus I
  * Calculus II
  * Calculus III (or Statistics, or another math course beyond Calculus II)

##### Technical Courses

  * A minimum of two (2) courses in engineering, computer science,
    mathematical science, or physical science

## Dual-Degree and Joint Programs

### Duke Environmental Management

In this 60-credit program, students earn _both_ :

  * Master of Engineering Management, from Duke's Pratt School of Engineering
    (24 credits), **_and_**
  * Master of Environmental Management, from Duke's Nicholas School of the
    Environment (36 credits)

Dual-master's students are charged flat tuition during the first two (2) years
of study—which is _**less than studying for each degree separately**_.

#### Important Notes

  * Separate applications and admission to each professional school are
    required
  * Students requiring additional coursework beyond four (4) semesters will
    incur additional charges
  * Students do not receive either degree until all requirements for both
    degrees are completed

learn more.

## US Navy Partnership

### Course Credits for Nuclear Propulsion Officers

Through a partnership between Duke and the United States Navy, Nuclear
Propulsion Program Officers receive credit for their training and service.

They earn a Duke Master of Engineering Management by completing just six (6)
courses, instead of the usual eight (8).

#### Duke will recognize

  * **Six (6) hours of technical elective credit** (equivalent to two Duke
    courses) for Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program training
  * **Naval service** to satisfy the internship and capstone requirements
    (EGRMGMT 550 and 551)

#### How to Apply

  1. Contact your commanding officer, and gain approval
  2. Request your commanding officer to submit a Letter of Support as part of the recommendation portion of your online application

#### Important Notes

    Services Transcript
  * There may be other miscellaneous required degree components beyond
    coursework
  * For more information, contact memp@duke.edu

## For Current Duke Students

### Duke Engineering Undergraduates—4+1: BSE+Master's

Duke undergraduates studying engineering can complete a Bachelor of Science in
Engineering (BSE) _and_ a Master of Engineering Management in just five (5)
years.

**4+1: BSE+Master's** is an accelerated program in which undergraduates take
graduate-level courses during the senior year.

Visit pratt.duke.edu for more information »

### Duke Engineering Graduate Students

Duke Master of Science (MS) and PhD students in other academic departments of
Duke's Pratt School of Engineering may use up to three (3) graduate
engineering courses as technical electives for the Duke Master of Engineering
Management (MEM).

Generally, these courses should be taken concurrently with the MEM degree, or
within the previous four years.

Through a dual-degree program, a Duke Master of Science or PhD student can
receive a Master of Engineering Management as well by completing:

  * The five (5) additional courses
  * An internship
  * A seminar and workshop series
  * Miscellaneous other requirements

#### Important Notes

  * Separate application and admission to Duke Master of Engineering
    Management are required
  * Applications should be submitted **at least one year before** the
    graduation date of your Duke MS or PhD degree
  * Separate tuition is charged for Duke Engineering Management courses

### Other Duke Graduate and Professional Students

Duke graduate and professional students who are not enrolled in the Duke
Master of Engineering Management Program may register to enroll in some
Engineering Management core courses and technical electives on a space-
available basis and with the permission of the instructor.

Instructors will require outside students to have sufficient background for
the course. They may also limit enrollment of outside students for any
pedagogical reason.

Duke students not in Engineering Management but who wish to take our courses
should:

  * Complete the Course Registration Permission Form
  * Obtain permission from the instructor
  * Obtain permission from their home department
  * Return the completed permission form to the Duke MEM Office before the
    Last Day of Drop/Add

#### Important Notes

  * Course Registration Permission forms are not processed until all Duke
    Engineering Management students have had a chance to enroll—outside
    students may not be added to a course as late as the end of the first week
    of a semester
  * Outside students will not be added to waiting lists but are added to
    classes in the order in which they completed their forms
  * Generally, no more than five (5) outside students are allowed to enroll in
    any one course in any semester
  * These students may _not_ utilize these courses later for a Duke Master of
    Engineering Management degree

For more information, contact the Duke Master of Engineering Management
office.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON STUDENT TRANSFERS**

Please know that students do not “transfer” from other institutions into this
Duke master's degree program. Instead, graduate courses taken elsewhere may
fill Duke's core required courses. But, permission is required. Also, all
students are required to take eight (8) courses at Duke.
