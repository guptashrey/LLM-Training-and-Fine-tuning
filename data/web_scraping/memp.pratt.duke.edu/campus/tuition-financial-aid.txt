## Financial Aid

Because the Duke Master of Engineering Management is a professional degree,
most students pay their own tuition costs. Below, find information on selected
internal and external aid opportunities.  

### Loans

Financial aid packages for domestic master's degree students are limited to
the Direct Lending Federal Loan Programs.

If you are eligible for federal financial aid, please complete the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

The FAFSA is required for any need-based loan program, including work-study.

Duke's school code is **002920**.

  * Visit the Duke Financial Aid website for more information on application
    procedures
  * Duke maintains information on lenders for US Citizens and Permanent
    Residents, and for non-US citizens
  * Students awarded federal loans must make satisfactory academic progress
    toward their degrees - review these guidelines

### Fellowships and Scholarships

The Duke Master of Engineering Management Program has limited financial
assistance available through the following fellowships for **US Citizens and
Permanent Residents** :

#### Diversity Scholarships for Underrepresented Students

Selected students, who by reason of their background, culture, socioeconomic
status, race, ethnicity, work, and life experiences contribute to a fuller
representation of perspectives within the academic life of the university, may
receive up to 50 percent per year in tuition scholarship through our Diversity
Scholarships.

Recipients must be US citizens or permanent residents. Selection is based on
information submitted through the application, including demonstrated
leadership, GPA and GRE scores.

#### Wilkinson and Garda Fellowships for Outstanding Students

The Wilkinson and Garda Fellowships offer a tuition fellowship of $10,000 to
two selected students with outstanding undergraduate records. Recipients must
be US citizens or permanent residents, and selection will be determined based
on information submitted through the Duke Master of Engineering Management
application, including demonstrated leadership, GPA and GRE scores.

#### DoD SMART Scholarship Program

The Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship
for Service Program has been established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to
support undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program aims
to increase the number of civilian scientists and engineers working at DoD
laboratories. Read more...

### Veteran's Benefits

Duke offers information for veterans of the US Armed Forces who may apply for
VA benefits, including the Yellow Ribbon Program.

### External Funding Opportunities

### On-Campus Work

  * **Teaching assistantships** are available in some academic departments.
    Some departments may have **research assistantships.** Positions are
    generally posted (Duke NetID required) and filled each semester, shortly
    _before_ classes begin
  * Duke graduate students may also work as **Resident Assistants** and
    **Graduate Residents** in Duke's on-campus housing

### Not Eligible for GEM Fellowship

Though Duke’s Graduate School appears on a list of schools honoring the GEM
fellowship, the Duke Master of Engineering Management Program (Duke MEMP) is
_not_ eligible for the GEM fellowship.

This is because Duke MEMP is a professional program offered by Duke's Pratt
School of Engineering, _not_ its Graduate School. Also, limited available
financial aid in this master's degree program does not meet the expectation
that tuition and fees be covered by the participating university.
