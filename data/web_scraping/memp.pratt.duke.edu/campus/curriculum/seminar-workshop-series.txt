# Seminar & Workshop Series

Our students learn critical skills from dedicated experts

Through our professional development seminar and workshop series, Duke
Engineering Management students develop professional skills through a weekly
seminar and workshop series.

Students are required to complete seven (7) workshops organized through course
**EGRMGMT 501**. It is offered in both the spring and fall semesters.

> “This seminar really helped students realize that people around us have
> quite different cultural and career backgrounds. The seminar also offered
> ideas for us to promote ourselves, which was quite useful.”

> **Student Feedback**
