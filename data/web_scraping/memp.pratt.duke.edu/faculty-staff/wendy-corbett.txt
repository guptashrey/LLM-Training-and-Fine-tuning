# Wendy Gates Corbett

Adjunct Associate Professor in the Pratt School of Engineering

In my experience, leaders shape the cultures in which they lead and the
environment or 'personality' of a workplace mirrors its leaders' personality.

In my 15+ years working in and with technology companies, most of my managers
were engineers. Many (but not all) of them became leaders because they were
great engineers, not because of their ability to lead. I am delighted to join
the teaching team for the EGRMGMT 540 class, Management in High-Tech
Industries and to play a role in helping tomorrow's engineering leaders
discover their own leadership style.

Discovering my own leadership style was pivotal to my own professional growth.
It shows up in my teaching approach: fostering an active, collaborative
atmosphere where we all learn from each other's experiences.

I am currently researching personal, interpersonal, and cultural factors that
contribute to organizational culture, specifically a sense of belonging at
work. Creating workspaces where employees are (and feel) included, respected,
and seen is important to me and creating leaders who understand the importance
of how they contribute to the organizational culture is, too.
