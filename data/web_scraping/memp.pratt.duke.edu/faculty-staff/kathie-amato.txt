# Kathie Amato

Adjunct Associate Professor and Senior Lecturing Fellow, Duke Innovation &
Entrepreneurship Initiative

Kathie teaches in the Duke Master of Engineering Management program at the
Pratt School of Engineering, and Duke's Innovation & Entrepreneurship
Initiative.

Before moving to full-time teaching (which she loves), Kathie served as the
senior strategist for education at Duke I&E, where she helped develop Duke’s
undergraduate I&E certificate. She also served as an associate dean at Duke’s
Fuqua School of Business, where she managed creating and launching a one-year
master’s degree program.

Kathie has an extensive background in higher education, marketing, and
publishing. The link which ties her experience together is a strong emphasis
on entrepreneurship. Before coming to Duke in 2006, she founded and managed a
publishing company, AD Productions, Inc. In addition, she was the founding
director of Darden Business Publishing at the University of Virginia’s Darden
School of Business.

Kathie began her career in brand management with General Mills, where she
managed the development of several new products and General Mills’ entry into
several new product categories. She also worked at AT&T in various marketing
and sales management roles and served as vice president of marketing for a
company specializing in office connectivity products.

Kathie has an MBA from the University of Virginia’s Darden School and a
bachelor’s degree from Wake Forest University.
