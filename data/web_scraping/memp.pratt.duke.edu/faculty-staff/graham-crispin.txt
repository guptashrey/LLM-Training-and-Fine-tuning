# Graham Crispin

Adjunct Instructor in the Pratt School of Engineering

I mentor Duke Master of Engineering Management student consultants to grow
their professional competency and deliver meaningful strategic business
results to their sponsor clients.

Each semester project is a new and unique. The process has the students build
a consulting practice for their client's project including Adult Learning
paradigm to create a skills inventory, learning and competency evaluation
path; selecting paradigms, processes, methodologies that drive toward the
client's objective.

Primary, secondary research in the subject industry result in analysis and
construction of meaningful plans to execute high-growth business value.

Most importantly, the students take with them a hard-won success that drives
their expectations of their capabilities and confidence of never-ending career
achievements.
