## Ways to Partner with Duke

### Online Education for Your Employees

Duke offers the Master of Engineering Management online for working
professionals—it features three week-long **** residencies on our campus over
two years of study.

Our online Engineering Management students take the same core curriculum and
work with the same faculty as our on-campus students: marketing, finance,
intellectual property and business law, and management. In addition, they
focus on building expertise in commercialization, finance, or operations
management, with additional technical electives to further their technical
knowledge.

Duke's innovative learning method integrates the flexibility of online classes
with cohort-centric residencies that promote skill and knowledge development
through activities, seminars, and workshops.

A typical internship is eight to 12 weeks, with eight weeks being the minimum
