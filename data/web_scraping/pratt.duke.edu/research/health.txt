# Personal, Environmental & Population Health

Duke engineers are deeply engaged in **improving the health of humans and our
environment** —from understanding and ameliorating disease at the molecular
and genetic level, to developing technologies to improve global health, to
exploring the interconnections between human health and environmental quality.
A hallmark of our approach is extensive collaborations with leading physicians
and scientists at Duke’s School of Medicine and Nicholas School of the
Environment.
