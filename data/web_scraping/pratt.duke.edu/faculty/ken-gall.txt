# Ken Gall

Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Professor Gall’s research aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the
relationship between the processing, structure, and mechanical properties of
materials. His scientific contributions range from the creation and
understanding of shape memory metals and polymers to the discovery of a new
phase transformation in metal nanowires. His current research interests are 3D
printed metals and polymers, soft synthetic biomaterials, and biopolymers with
structured surface porous networks.

In addition to his research he has consulted for industry, the US Military and
the US Intelligence Community, and served as an expert witness in multiple
patent and product litigations. Finally, he is a passionate entrepreneur who
uses fundamental scientific knowledge to hasten the commercialization of new
materials and improve the effectiveness of existing materials. He founded two
medical device start-up companies, MedShape and Vertera who have
commercialized university based technologies in the orthopedic medical device
space.
