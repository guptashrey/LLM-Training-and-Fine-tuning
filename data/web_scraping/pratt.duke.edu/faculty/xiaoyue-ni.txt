# Xiaoyue Ni

Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

The Ni group aims to realize human-oriented materials intelligence through the
combination of soft electronics and digital metamaterials—the materials can
sense human signals, transform and adapt their functional properties according
to human actions or status. The technical approach embraces epidermal
electronics for advanced sensing of body mechanics, and micro/nanomechanics
for closed-loop programmable matter. Our research focuses on creating digital-
physical interfaces for dynamic control over materials properties via a full
spectrum of mechanical and acoustic processes.
