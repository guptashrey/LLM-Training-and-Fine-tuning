# Pranam D. Chatterjee

Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering

We develop diverse algorithmic modalities to discover, characterize, and
engineer novel proteins for applications in genome editing, targeted protein
modulation, and reproductive bioengineering.

Our long-term goals are two-fold:

  1. Enable the _de novo_ design of protein effectors for any biological purpose
  2. Leverage our platform technologies to prolong and promote reproductive longevity and equality
