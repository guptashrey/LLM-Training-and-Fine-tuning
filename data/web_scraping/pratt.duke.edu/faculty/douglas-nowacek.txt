# Douglas Nowacek

Randolph K. Repass and Sally-Christine Rodgers University Distinguished
Professor of Conservation Technology in Environment and Engineering

Sound propagates very efficiently through sea water, and marine mammals take
advantage of this medium to communicate and explore their environment. My
research is focused on the link between acoustic and motor behavior in marine
mammals, primarily cetaceans and manatees, specifically, how they use sound in
ecological processes. The cetaceans, or whales and dolphins, are divided into
two main groups, the toothed whales (odontocetes) and the baleen whales
(mysticetes). One of my specific areas of research is the use of echolocation
and foraging behavior in one of the odontocetes, the bottlenose dolphin.
Another focus of my current research is the effect(s) of anthropogenic noise
on marine mammals.
