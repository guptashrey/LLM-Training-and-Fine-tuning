# William T. Joines

Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

William T. Joines earned the BS degree from North Carolina State University,
MS, and PhD degrees from Duke University (all in electrical engineering) in
1959, 1961, and 1964, respectively. After high school and before college he
served for four years in the United States Air Force (1951-1955) as an
airborne radar technician. From 1959 to 1966 he was a Member of the Technical
Staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories doing research and development of missile
tracking and guidance radar. He joined the Electrical Engineering Department
of Duke University as an Assistant Professor in 1966. He was appointed as an
Associate Professor in 1968 and a Full Professor in 1979. His current research
interests include electromagnetic field and wave interactions with materials
and structures. He is a member of the Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, Phi Kappa
Phi, and Sigma Xi, honor societies. He is a Life Fellow of the IEEE, a recent
recipient of the Outstanding Engineering Educator Award from the IEEE, and the
Scientific and Technical Achievement Award presented by the Environmental
Protection Agency. He has supervised more than 60 graduate students in their
thesis and dissertation research leading to their MS and PhD degrees.
