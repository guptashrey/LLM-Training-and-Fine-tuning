# Piotr E. Marszalek

Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

My research focuses on investigating relationships between structural and
mechanical properties of biopolymers (polysaccharides, DNA, proteins), which I
study at a single molecule level. My main approaches are experimental scanning
probe microscopy techniques and computational methods involving Molecular
Dynamics simulations and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The
ultimate goal of this research is to understand the above-mentioned
relationships at an atomic level and to apply the knowledge gained towards
elucidating basic phenomena such as: molecular recognition that mediates
interactions between proteins and sugars, mechanotransduction that underlies
mechanical sensing and hearing in all organisms, and protein folding that is
fundamental to all biology. Our DNA research is aimed at exploiting atomic
force microscopy techniques to develop new ultra-sensitive assays for
detecting and examining DNA damage, the process underlying carcinogenesis, and
to increase our mechanistic understanding of DNA damage and repair processes.
This research, in addition to its basic science aspects will lay a foundation
for the future use of AFM technologies in the nanoscale DNA diagnostics with a
potential to directly benefit human health.
