# Marc A. Sommer

Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering

We study circuits for cognition. Using a combination of neurophysiology and
biomedical engineering, we focus on the interaction between brain areas during
visual perception, decision-making, and motor planning. Specific projects
include the role of frontal cortex in metacognition, the role of cerebellar-
frontal circuits in action timing, the neural basis of "good enough" decision-
making (satisficing), and the neural mechanisms of transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS).

## Appointments and Affiliations

## Education

  * Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1995

## Research Interests

Neuronal circuits of the brain, including recording from single neurons and
studying the effects of inactivating or stimulating well-defined brain areas.
His goals are to understand how individual areas process signals and how
multiple areas interact to cause cognition and behavior. Results from the work
are guiding the design of vision-based models and robots.
