# Jonathan Viventi

Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

Dr. Viventi’s research uses flexible electronics to create new technology for
interfacing with the brain at high resolution over large areas. These new
tools can help diagnose and treat neurological disorders such as epilepsy, and
help improve the performance of brain machine interfaces.
