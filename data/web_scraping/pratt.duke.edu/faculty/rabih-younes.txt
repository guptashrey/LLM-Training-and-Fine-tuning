# Rabih Younes

Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering

Rabih Younes received his PhD in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech in
2018 after receiving his BE and MSE in Computer Engineering from the Lebanese
American University in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Rabih speaks nine
languages (fluent in three) and holds a number of certificates in education,
networking, IT, and skydiving. He is also a member of several honor societies,
including Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, Phi Kappa Phi, and Golden Key.

Rabih has a passion for both teaching and research; he has been teaching since
he was a teenager, and his research interests include wearable computing,
activity recognition, context awareness, machine learning, engineering
education, and Middle Eastern politics. As a professor, Rabih is committed to
helping his students achieve their goals and providing them with opportunities
to realize that. He also focuses on their personal development and on
improving their abilities to be critical thinkers, better communicators, and
active members of their community and the world.
