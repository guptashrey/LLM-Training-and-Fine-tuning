# Xin Li

Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Prof. Xin Li received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering
from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2005, and the
M.S. and B.S. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Fudan University,
Shanghai, China, in 2001 and 1998, respectively.  
  
In 2005, he co-founded Xigmix Inc. to commercialize his PhD research, and
served as the Chief Technical Officer until the company was acquired by
Extreme DA in 2007. In 2011, Extreme DA was further acquired by Synopsis
(Nasdaq: SNPS). From 2009 to 2012, he was the Assistant Director for FCRP
Focus Research Center for Circuit & System Solutions (C2S2), a national
consortium of 13 research universities (CMU, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, UIUC,
UMich, Columbia, UCLA, among others) chartered by the U.S. semiconductor
industry and U.S. Department of Defense to work on next-generation integrated
circuit design challenges. From 2014 to 2015, he was the Assistant Director
for the Center for Silicon System Implementation (CSSI), a CMU research center
with 20 faculty members working on integrated circuits and systems. His
research interests include integrated circuit, signal processing and data
analytics.  
  
He was an Associate Editor of IEEE Trans. on Biomedical Engineering (TBME),
IEEE Trans. on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems
(TCAD), ACM Trans. on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), IEEE
Design & Test (D&T), and Journal of Low Power Electronics (JOLPE). He was the
Guest Editor for IEEE TCAD, IEEE TNANO, IEEE TBD, IEEE D&T, IEEE JETCAS, ACM
TCPS, ACM JETC and VLSI Integration. He served on the Executive Committee of
ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA), IEEE Systems, Man,
and Cybernetics Society Technical Committee on Cybernetics for Cyber-Physical
Systems (TCCCPS), and IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on VLSI
(TCVLSI). He was the General Chair of ISVLSI, iNIS and FAC, and the Technical
Program Chair of CAD/Graphics. He also served on the ACM/SIGDA Outstanding PhD
Dissertation Award Selection Committee, the IEEE TTTC E. J. McCluskey Best
Doctoral Thesis Selection Committee, the IEEE Outstanding Young Author Award
Selection Committee, the Executive Committee of ISVLSI, GLSVLSI and iNIS, and
the Technical Program Committee of DAC, ICCAD, ITC, ISVLSI, FAC, CAD/Graphics,
ASICON and VLSI. He received the NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award
(CAREER) in 2012, two IEEE Donald O. Pederson Best Paper Awards in 2013 and
2016, the Best Paper Award from Design Automation Conference (DAC) in 2010,
two IEEE/ACM William J. McCalla ICCAD Best Paper Awards in 2004 and 2011, and
the Best Paper Award from International Symposium on Integrated Circuits
(ISIC) in 2014. In addition to these awards, he also received six Best Paper
Nominations from Design Automation Conference (DAC), International Conference
on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) and Custom Integrated Circuits Conference
(CICC).
