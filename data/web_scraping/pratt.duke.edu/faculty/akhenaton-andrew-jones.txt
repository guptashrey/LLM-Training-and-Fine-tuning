# Akhenaton-Andrew Dhafir Jones

Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Dr. Jones' research focuses on addressing global challenges in water and
bacteria using engineering and policy analysis. On the microscale this has
included efforts exploring how bacteria and bacterial biofilms form and
function under fluid, chemical, electrical, and nanomaterial stress. On the
human scale this has included systems engineering analysis on how material
technology systems can be deployed to increase equity.
