# Henry Pfister

Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Henry D. Pfister received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2003 from the
University of California, San Diego and is currently a professor in the
Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Duke University with a
secondary appointment in Mathematics. Prior to that, he was an associate
professor at Texas A&M University (2006-2014), a post-doctoral fellow at the
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (2005-2006), and a senior engineer at
Qualcomm Corporate R&D in San Diego (2003-2004). His current research
interests include information theory, error-correcting codes, quantum
computing, and machine learning.

He received the NSF Career Award in 2008 and a Texas A&M ECE Department
Outstanding Professor Award in 2010. He is a coauthor of the 2007 IEEE COMSOC
best paper in Signal Processing and Coding for Data Storage and a coauthor of
a 2016 Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) best paper. He has served
the IEEE Information Theory Society as a member of the Board of Governors
(2019-2022), an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory (2013-2016), and a Distinguished Lecturer (2015-2016). He was also the
General Chair of the 2016 North American School of Information Theory.
