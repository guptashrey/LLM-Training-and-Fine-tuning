# Sharon Gerecht

Paul M. Gross Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Gerecht’s research group studies how the microenvironment regulates cellular
responses, with the long-term goal of developing countermeasures and
therapeutics. We develop biomaterials and culture systems to emulate
mechanical and physical stressors toward understanding tissue function,
reliance, and homeostasis. We also use that information to uncover pathways in
injury and disease development to guide tissue healing and regeneration. We
focus on blood vessels and their multifaceted roles in tissue performance,
aging, and disease.
