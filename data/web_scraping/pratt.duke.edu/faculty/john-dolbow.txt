# John Everett Dolbow

Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Professor John E. Dolbow came to Duke University from Northwestern University,
where he received an MS and PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. During
the course of his graduate study, John was a Computational Science Graduate
Fellow for the Department of Energy, and he spent a summer working at Los
Alamos National Laboratory. Dr. Dolbow's research concerns the development of
computational methods for nonlinear problems in solid mechanics. In
particular, he is interested in modeling quasi-static and dynamic fracture of
structural components, the evolution of interfaces with nonlinear constitutive
laws, and developing models for stimulus-responsive hydrogels. A native of New
Hampshire, Dr. Dolbow received his Bachelor's Degree in mechanical engineering
from the University of New Hampshire.
