# Brenton D. Hoffman

James L. and Elizabeth M. Vincent Associate Professor of Biomedical
Engineering

The overall goal of my research program is to utilize an interdisciplinary
approach to first advance the basic understanding of mechanotransduction on
multiple scales and then use this knowledge to guide the development of new
treatments for mechanosensitive diseases. Our work combines principles and
techniques from protein engineering, molecular biology, soft matter physics,
cell and developmental biology, biomaterials engineering, automated image
analysis, and state of the art live cell microscopy. Specifically, we engineer
and use biosensors that report the tension across specific proteins in living
cells through changes in the color of light they emit. This technology enables
dynamic measurements of proteins and sub-cellular structures that are under
load. Unlike more traditional techniques that measure the entirety of cellular
force output, the ability of these sensors to measure mechanical stress at the
molecular level means they are innately compatible with concepts and
approaches common in molecular biology and biophysics.
