# Steven A. Cummer

William H. Younger Distinguished Professor of Engineering

Dr. Steven Cummer received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford
University in 1997 and prior to joining Duke University in 1999 he spent two
years at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as an NRC postdoctoral research
associate. Awards he has received include a National Science Foundation CAREER
award and a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers
(PECASE) in 2001. His current work is in a variety of theoretical and
experimental electromagnetic problems related to geophysical remote sensing
and engineered electromagnetic materials.
