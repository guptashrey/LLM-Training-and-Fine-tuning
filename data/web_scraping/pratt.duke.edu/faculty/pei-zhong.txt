# Pei Zhong

Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

My research focuses on engineering and technology development with
applications in the non-invasive or minimally invasive treatment of kidney
stone disease via shock wave and laser lithotripsy, high-intensity focused
ultrasound (HIFU) and immunotherapy for cancer treatment, acoustic and optical
cavitation, and ultrasound neuromodulation via sonogenetics.

We are taking an integrated and translational approach that combines
fundamental research with engineering and applied technology development to
devise novel and enabling ultrasonic, optical, and mechanical tools for a
variety of clinical applications. We are interested in shock wave/laser-fluid-
bubble-solid interaction, and resultant mechanical and thermal fields that
lead to material damage and removal. We also investigate the stress response
of biological cell and tissue induced by cavitation and ultrasound exposure,
mediated through mechanosensitive ion channels, such as Piezo 1. Our research
activities are primarily supported by NIH and through collaborations with the
medical device industry.
