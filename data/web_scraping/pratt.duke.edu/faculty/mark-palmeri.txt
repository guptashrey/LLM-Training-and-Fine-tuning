# Mark L. Palmeri

Professor of the Practice in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

Mark L. Palmeri received his B.S. degree in Biomedical and Electrical
Engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2000. He was a James B. Duke
graduate fellow and received his Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from
Duke University in 2005 and his M.D. degree from the Duke University School of
Medicine in 2007. He is currently a Professor of the Practice in Biomedical
Engineering and Anesthesiology at Duke University. He is an Associate Editor
for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology and he serves as a member of the RSNA
Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) committee for ultrasound shear
wave speed imaging. His research interests include acoustic radiation force
shear wave elasticity imaging, ultrasonic imaging, finite element analysis of
soft tissue response to acoustic radiation force excitation, medical image
processing, deep learning and medical instrumentation design.
