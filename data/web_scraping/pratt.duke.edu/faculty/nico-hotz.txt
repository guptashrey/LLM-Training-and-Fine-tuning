# Nico Hotz

Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering and Materials Science

Nico Hotz specializes in interfacial transport phenomena and thermodynamics in
energy technology. His research focuses on heat, mass, and charge transfer on
nano-scale surfaces for solar thermal applications, catalytic fuel reforming,
hydrogen generation, fuel cells, and electrolysis.

## Education

  * Ph.D. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Switzerland), 2008

## Research Interests

Interfacial transport phenomena and thermodynamics in energy technology,
including phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. Thermodynamics aspects of
photovoltaics, novel sustainable energy conversion technologies, and chemical
reactions are an essential part of my research. My main focus in research is
the combination of ideas, insights and results from traditional energy
technology such as thermal power plants with novel and innovative technologies
such a fuel cells and photovoltaic cells based on micro- and nanostructured
materials. An essential topi of my research interests is the energetic and
exergetic analysis of complex energy conversion and storage systems,
especially including renewable and sustainable energy solutions.
