# Earl H. Dowell

William Holland Hall Distinguished Professor

Professor Dowell's principal teaching interest and research activity is in the
field of aeroelasticity - which is the study of the dynamic interaction
between an aerodynamic flow and an elastic structure, such as aircraft wings
in high speed flight, long span bridges and tall buildings responding to wind
loadings, or airflow through the mouth and lungs. Dr. Dowell has also done
research in acoustics, nonlinear dynamics, structural dynamics, and unsteady
aerodynamics.

Professor Dowell's major research accomplishments include the first definitive
research monograph on the aeroelasticity of plates and shells, the first
derivation and solution of the nonlinear equations of motion for a helicopter
rotor blade (the Hodges-Dowell equations), and work with Professor Kenneth
Hall and several graduate students and post-doctoral fellows on reducing the
dimensions of mathematical models for very complex high-dimensional
fluid/structural systems. Professor Dowell teaches undergraduate and graduate
courses on dynamics and aeroelasticity.

Here are seven short videos showing experimental aeroelastic models undergoing
limit cycle oscillations in the Duke wind tunnel.

  1. An airfoil with a nonlinear freeplay  in the connection from the main airfoil to the trailing edge control surface.
  2. A delta wing with a strong structural nonlinearity  as a result of tension in the mid-plane of the plate-like wing induced by bending of the wing out of its initially undeformed plane.
  3. A very high aspect ratio wing  that behaves as a beam with double bending (both transverse to and in-line with the aerodynamic flow field) and twisting. A nonlinear coupling among double bending and twisting occurs. Also the aerodynamic flow field experiences separation due to the large motions involved.
  4. A delta wing with an external store, flutter and limit cycle oscillations.
  5. LCO and Flutter of WingStore model
  6. Flapping Flag Flutter
  7. LCO of Cropped Delta Wing In the video you will see a cropped delta wing (that simply means we cropped off that would otherwise be a delta or triangular wing). The wind speed in the wind tunnel is shown by the dial in one of the frames. In the other two frames you see signals from two strain gauge bridges, bending and torsion, and of course the wing itself.   
The wind speed at which flutter is predicted to occur theoretically is about
19 meters/second. The experimental flutter speed based on observation of the
strain gauge signals is about 21 meters/second. Note that at the wind speed
when flutter starts, both strain gauges show dominant response at a frequency
of 12 Hz. This large peak at a single frequency is a characteristic identifier
of flutter. Also note that the motion of the wing is not easily visible to the
eye until a higher wind speed in the range of 24-26 meters/second and the
motion is most visible at the wing tip. Once the flutter speed is exceeded,
limit cycle oscillations occur due a strong structural nonlinearity.
