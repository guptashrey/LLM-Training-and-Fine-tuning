# Marc Deshusses

Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Dr. Deshusses' research interests are related to the design, analysis and
application of remediation, waste to energy and decentralized sanitation
processes. A current focus is on novel reactors and processes for air, water
and solid wastes treatment. Applications include treatment of odors and air
toxics, biogas production, and novel sanitation and treatment technologies.
Research interests include bioenergy and waste to energy processes, biofilms,
biomolecular techniques for monitoring microorganisms in complex environments,
indoor air quality, advanced oxidation processes, nanosensors, and
mathematical modeling of environmental processes.
