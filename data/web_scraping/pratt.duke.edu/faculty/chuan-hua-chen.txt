# Chuan-Hua Chen

Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science

Chuan-Hua Chen's research interests lie in experimental and theoretical
investigations of small-scale physicochemical hydrodynamics, where transport
and interfacial phenomena closely interact with each other.

By manipulating surface tension actively and passively, e.g. using electric
fields and surface structures, we are developing innovative solutions for
applications ranging from bioanalytical assays to microelectronics cooling.
