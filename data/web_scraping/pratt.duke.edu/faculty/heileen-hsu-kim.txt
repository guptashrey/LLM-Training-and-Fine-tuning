# Heileen Hsu-Kim

Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Professor Heileen (Helen) Hsu-Kim is an environmental engineer who specializes
in environmental aquatic chemistry and geochemistry. Her research tackles
problems related to pollutant metals and the biogeochemical processes that
alter their distribution in water, soil, and air. The applications of this
work include environmental remediation technologies, the impacts of energy
production on water resources, global environmental health, and the
environmental implications and applications of nanotechnology.

Dr. Hsu-Kim's current research projects are focused on mercury
biogeochemistry, the impacts of coal ash disposal on water quality, recovering
valuable materials from geological wastes, and health impacts of trace
metal/metalloid exposures. A central theme to her work is the utilization of
chemical speciation for understanding and predicting the persistence, mobility
and bioavailability of metals and minerals in the aquatic environment.

The methodologies her group employs for this research include laboratory
techniques for quantifying trace element speciation, functional measures of
reactivity and bioavailability of contaminant metals, and techniques to probe
interactions at mineral, water and microbial interfaces.
