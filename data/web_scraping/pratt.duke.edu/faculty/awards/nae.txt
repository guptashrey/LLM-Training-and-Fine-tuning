# Duke Members of the National Academy of Engineering

More than 30 Duke alumni and faculty have been elected since the Academy's
founding in 1964

Election to the National Academy of Engineering is considered the greatest
professional honor for an engineer in the United States.

As you can read below, Duke members of the NAE have made significant
contributions to our national and global communities through discoveries and
leadership in advanced computing, environmental engineering, aeromechanics,
medical device design and much more.

At Duke, election to the NAE is a community celebration. When a member of our
community is elected to the NAE, their citation is permanently inscribed into
the Fitzpatrick Center Recognition Wall—creating a permanent and visible
source of inspiration for the Duke community.
