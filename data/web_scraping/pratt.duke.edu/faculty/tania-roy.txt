# Tania Roy

Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Roy's work focuses on applying emerging neuromorphic computer hardware
technologies to machine learning applications. By modeling computer
architecture after the basic structure of synapses and neurons, hardware can
be manufactured to be better adapted to pattern recognition algorithms. She
also focuses on high-energy electronics made with gallium nitride, a
semiconductor that is poised to replace silicon in certain areas of computer
hardware. Because of its physical characteristics, the material is well suited
for high-energy and high-radiation applications, such as those found outside
of Earth’s atmosphere.
