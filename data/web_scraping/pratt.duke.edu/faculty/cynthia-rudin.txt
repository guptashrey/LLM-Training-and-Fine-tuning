# Cynthia D. Rudin

Earl D. McLean, Jr. Professor

Cynthia Rudin is a professor of computer science, electrical and computer
engineering, statistical science, and biostatistics & bioinformatics at Duke
University, and directs the Interpretable Machine Learning Lab. Previously,
Prof. Rudin held positions at MIT, Columbia, and NYU. She holds an
undergraduate degree from the University at Buffalo, and a PhD from Princeton
University. She is the recipient of the 2022 Squirrel AI Award for Artificial
Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the
Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). This award, similar only to
world-renowned recognitions, such as the Nobel Prize and the Turing Award,
carries a monetary reward at the million-dollar level. She is also a three-
time winner of the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, was
named as one of the "Top 40 Under 40" by Poets and Quants in 2015, and was
named by Businessinsider.com as one of the 12 most impressive professors at
MIT in 2015. She is a fellow of the American Statistical Association and a
fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

She is past chair of both the INFORMS Data Mining Section and the Statistical
Learning and Data Science Section of the American Statistical Association. She
has also served on committees for DARPA, the National Institute of Justice,
AAAI, and ACM SIGKDD. She has served on three committees for the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, including the Committee on
Applied and Theoretical Statistics, the Committee on Law and Justice, and the
Committee on Analytic Research Foundations for the Next-Generation Electric
Grid. She has given keynote/invited talks at several conferences including KDD
(twice), AISTATS, CODE, Machine Learning in Healthcare (MLHC), Fairness,
Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT-ML), ECML-PKDD, and
the Nobel Conference. Her work has been featured in news outlets including the
NY Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe,
Businessweek, and NPR.
