# Roarke W. Horstmeyer

Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering

Roarke Horstmeyer is an assistant professor within Duke's Biomedical
Engineering Department. He develops microscopes, cameras and computer
algorithms for a wide range of applications, from forming 3D reconstructions
of organisms to detecting neural activity deep within tissue. His areas of
interest include optics, signal processing, optimization and neuroscience.
Most recently, Dr. Horstmeyer was a guest professor at the University of
Erlangen in Germany and an Einstein postdoctoral fellow at Charitè Medical
School in Berlin. Prior to his time in Germany, Dr. Horstmeyer earned a PhD
from Caltech’s electrical engineering department in 2016, a master of science
degree from the MIT Media Lab in 2011, and a bachelors degree in physics and
Japanese from Duke University in 2006.

## Appointments and Affiliations

## Research Interests

Computational optics, machine learning, and designing new algorithms for image
processing. A main focus is to improve how we capture and use images of
microscopic phenomena within a range of biomedical contexts. In general, I
like to create new optical devices that can improve the utility of the
information that we can gather about the world around us.
