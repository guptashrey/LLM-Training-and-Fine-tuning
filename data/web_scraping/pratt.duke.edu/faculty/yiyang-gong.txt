# Yiyang Gong

Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

We're interested in understanding brain function using the combination of
genetically encoded sensors and optical techniques. Using genetically encoded
tools, we can target specific neuron types or specific projection pathways for
recording or perturbation. Using optical microscopy, we can access individual
neurons with high spatial and temporal accuracy. By employing and developing
tools in both categories, we study brain circuitry by recording, perturbing,
and controlling brain activity in various preparations.

## Appointments and Affiliations

  * Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering
  * Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer
    Engineering
  * Assistant Professor in Neurobiology
  * Faculty Network Member of the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences
  * Associate of the Duke Initiative for Science & Society

## Education

  * Ph.D. Stanford University, 2011

## Research Interests

Recording and understanding brain activity by developing novel combinations of
optical microscopy and genetically encoded sensors. Using these technologies,
we wish to dissect neural circuit function and investigate how neural activity
drives complex behaviors.
