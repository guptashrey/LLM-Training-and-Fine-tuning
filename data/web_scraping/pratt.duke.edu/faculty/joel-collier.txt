# Joel Collier

Theodore Kennedy Professor of Biomedical Engineering

The Collier Lab designs biomaterials for a range of biomedical applications,
with a focus on understanding and controlling adaptive immune responses. Most
materials investigated are created from molecular assemblies- proteins,
peptides or bioconjugates that self-organize into useful structures such as
nanofibers, gels, and particles.

These biomaterials are being developed as novel treatments for infectious
diseases, cancer, wound healing, and chronic inflammation. Additionally, as
these strategies are developed, basic insights into how materials engage the
immune system are uncovered.
