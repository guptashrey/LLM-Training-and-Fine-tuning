## Research Interests

I enjoy solving difficult problems surrounding computations with the goal to
process large volumes of data efficiently. My research interests include
computer architecture and microarchitecture, hardware-software co-designs,
accelerators, and emerging application domains ― especially those in big data
analytics such as genomics, graphs, and databases. One of my research goals is
to greatly simplify the design, deployment, and usage of custom hardware and
to leverage this research in hardware acceleration to advance state-of-the-art
research in the healthcare domain as well as other natural sciences.
