# George A. Truskey

R. Eugene and Susie E. Goodson Distinguished Professor of Biomedical
Engineering

My research interests focus upon the effect of physical forces on the function
of vascular cells and skeletal muscle, cell adhesion, and the design of
engineered tissues. Current research projects examine the effect of
endothelial cell senescence upon permeability to macromolecules and the
response to fluid shear stress, the development of microphysiological blood
vessels and muscles for evaluation of drug toxicity and the design of
engineered endothelialized blood vessels and skeletal muscle bundles.
