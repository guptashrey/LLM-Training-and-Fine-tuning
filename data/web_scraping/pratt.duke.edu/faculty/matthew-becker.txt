# Matthew L Becker

Hugo L. Blomquist Distinguished Professor of Chemistry

The Becker Laboratory for Functional Biomaterials is a multidisciplinary
organic materials group working at the interface of chemistry, organic
materials and medicine. We are developing families of degradable polymers with
highly tunable physical and biological properties that are being applied to
unmet needs in bone, soft tissue, neural and vascular tissue engineering. We
are also actively engaged in additive manufacturing and the development of
custom inks that are enabling unique solutions to challenging design paradigms
in biomaterials and drug delivery.
