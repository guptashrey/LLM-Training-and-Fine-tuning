# Boyuan Chen

Assistant Professor in the Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering
and Materials Science

Boyuan Chen's research focuses on Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine
Learning. He is also broadly interested in AI for science. At Duke, he leads
the General Robotics Lab.

He is interested in developing "generalist robots" that learn, act, and
improve by perceiving and interacting with the complex and dynamic world.
Ultimately, he hopes that robots and machines can be equipped with high-level
cognitive skills to assist people and unleash human creativity.

Boyuan Chen obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Columbia University with
Hod Lipson.
