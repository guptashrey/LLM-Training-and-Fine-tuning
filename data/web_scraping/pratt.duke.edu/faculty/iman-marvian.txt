# Iman Marvian

Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Iman Marvian received his Ph.D. in Physics in 2012 at the University of
Waterloo and Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.
Before moving to Duke, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the
University of Southern California and MIT.

Marvian's main research interest is quantum information and computation
theory. He has worked on a wide range of topics in this field, including
quantum algorithms, quantum circuits, symmetry-protected topological order,
quantum error suppression, open quantum systems, quantum resource theories,
and quantum thermodynamics.
