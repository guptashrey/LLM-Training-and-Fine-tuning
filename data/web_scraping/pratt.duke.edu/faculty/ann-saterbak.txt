# Ann Saterbak

Professor of the Practice in the Department of Biomedical Engineering

Ann Saterbak is director of the Duke Engineering First-Year Experience and a
professor of the practice in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. She is
a nationally recognized engineering educator with a focus on creating
undergraduate programs that broaden students problem solving skills through
real-world problems, inquiry-based learning, and hands-on experiences. In fall
2017, she launched a new hands-on design course for first-year Pratt students.

Before coming to Duke, she was the associate dean for engineering education
and full teaching professor in bioengineering in the George R. Brown School of
Engineering at Rice University. At Rice, she launched a successful first-year
engineering design course in which students solved community-based, client-
driven problems and built physical prototypes. Her outstanding teaching at
Rice was recognized by four university-wide teaching awards. She is the lead
author of the textbook _Bioengineering Fundamentals_.

For her contribution to education within biomedical engineering, she was
elected a fellow in the Biomedical Engineering Society and the American
Society of Engineering Education. Saterbak has been a frequent presenter of
educational materials at annual ASEE and BMES conferences. In building the
undergraduate bioengineering laboratory at Rice, she applied four years of
industry experience working at the Shell Development Company.
