# Johann Guilleminot

Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Johann Guilleminot joined Duke on July 1, 2017, as an assistant professor of
civil and environmental engineering.

Prior to that, he was an assistant professor in the Multiscale Modeling and
Simulation Laboratory at Université Paris-Est in France, and held a visiting
assistant professor position in the Duke Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering.

He earned an MS (2005) and PhD (2008) in Theoretical Mechanics from the
University of Lille 1 – Science and Technology (France), and received his
Habilitation (2014) in Mechanics from Université Paris-Est. Habilitation is
the highest academic degree in France.

Dr. Guilleminot’s research focuses on uncertainty quantification,
computational mechanics and materials science, as well as on topics at the
interface between these fields. He is particularly interested in the
multiscale analysis of linear/nonlinear heterogeneous materials (including
biological and engineered ones), homogenization theory, statistical inverse
problems and stochastic modeling with applications for computational science
and engineering.
