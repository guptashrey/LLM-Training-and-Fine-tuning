# Guglielmo Scovazzi

Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

Guglielmo Scovazzi received B.S/M.S. in aerospace engineering (summa cum
laude) from Politecnico di Torino (Italy); and M.S. and Ph.D. in mechanical
engineering from Stanford University. Before coming to Duke, he was a Senior
Member of the Technical Staff in the Computer Science Research Institute at
Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM).

Dr. Scovazzi’s research interests include finite element and advanced
numerical methods for computational fluid and solid mechanics. His research
emphasizes accurate computational methods aimed at reducing the overall
design/analysis costs in multiphase porous media flows, highly transient
compressible and incompressible flows, turbulent flows, complex geometry
systems in solid mechanics, and fluid/structure interaction problems.
