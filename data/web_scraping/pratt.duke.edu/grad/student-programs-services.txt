> proud and happy Blue Devil now.”
>
> —Diggaj Vyas, MEM

## Career Services & Professional Development (CSPD)

the workplace. We provide on-demand resources, one-on-one coaching, peer-to-
peer supports, and a professional development workshop program designed to
meet the specific needs of Duke Engineering master’s students.

> globe and to assist them.”
>
> —Ravi Prakash, MEMS

> “The Career Services team has been an essential resource. Jenny, Cameo, and
> Erin have devoted a generous time and energy to reviewing my cover letters
> and resume. They're easily accessible for meetings, and are always
> responsive via MS Teams. It's also clear that they're interested in getting
> to know me outside of the professional sphere.”
>
> —Katie Wu, MEM

> “Career Services played a significant role in my career development journey.
> The advising sessions and interview practice helped me land an optimal job
> offer.”

> workshops into our master’s studies curriculum has molded me into a better,
> more well-rounded candidate for both the workforce and life in general.”
>
> —Carly Davey, MEM

> “Professional Development workshops have helped me establish a great work-

## Graduate Communications & Intercultural Programs (GCIP)

GCIP works with students to strengthen their written, oral and intercultural
communications skills through workshops, one-on-one consulting, and
collaboration with Duke Engineering professors and departments. GCIP also
works with some international students to provide English language support
through semester-long courses.

> revise academic writing, or have a casual chat to relieve the stress of
> graduate school life. GCIP’s professional coaching has helped me better
> survive and engage in the American classroom and community.”
>
> —Yueying Yang, ECE

> “SnackChat provides a unique way to share life experiences and great ideas.
> Having a place to discuss and share our feelings is really important to our
> mental health as well.”
>
> —Yunzhe Jia, ECE

> staff exemplify to students how to be professional—how to work with others,
> handle difficult situations, be candid, present yourself, and other skills
> that are absolutely crucial to future success.”
>
> —Dean Hering, Adjunct Associate Professor

## Student Engagement & Support (SES)

SES fosters engagement with students across all Duke Engineering master’s
Programs by creating community-building opportunities, like the Engineering
Master’s Student Council (EMSC), that complement the academic experience.
Together with our Duke-wide partners, we also support overall student
wellness—we have the resources, information, and referrals on hand to support
the wide range of our student's personal needs.

### What people are saying about SES

> “Koru Mindfulness taught me many ways to handle stress or other problems as
> a graduate student in day-to-day life! Sometimes if I was feeling sleepy
> during class, I would try the chicken breathing technique, which definitely
> wakes you up.”
>
> —Bidisha Nandi, BME

> “During my first year at Duke, I took five courses per semester. This heavy
> workload was stressful. When Smokey [the dog] showed up, sitting next to him
> helped me to release the pressure I felt.”
>
> —Ruoyu Chen, CEE

> “The Engineering Master’s Student Council wants students to round out their
> journey at Duke by learning about different cultures, perspectives, and
> backgrounds across all the different disciplines. The EMSC provides students
> with space outside the academic environment to build long-term
> relationships, be there for each other, and build a master's student
> family.”
>
> —Arlette Geller, BME
