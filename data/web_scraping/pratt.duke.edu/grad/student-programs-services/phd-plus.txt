# PhD Plus Professional Development Program

_Our mission is to enable engineering PhD students at Duke to prepare for,
select, and succeed on their career paths through acquiring skills, mastering
core competencies, and exploring opportunities_

  * Overview
  * Certificate & Deep Blue
  * Activities & Events
  * Leadership

## Overview

PhD Plus is a program of the Pratt School of Engineering that is available to
every engineering doctoral student at Duke.

We focus on empowering PhD students to transform themselves into well-
equipped, inspired and effective professionals and leaders.

Professional development topics include effective communication, project
management and team leadership.

Over a structured three-year cycle, Duke Engineering PhD students explore
careers in:

  * Academia
  * Industry & Government
  * Entrepreneurship, Business, Law & Consulting

Students who participate in PhD Plus graduate ready to launch successfully
onto their chosen career path.

## The PhD Plus Certificate

Progress is tracked on Duke Deep Blue via the Suitable app

PhD Plus operates on a three-year cycle. Each year focused on a different
career path—Academia, Industry & Government, or Entrepreneurship, Business,
Law & Consulting.

Students can begin working toward the optional PhD Plus Certificate in any
year by using Deep Blue to learn about PhD Plus events and to interactively
track progress toward completing certificate requirements.

A student who has earned the PhD Plus Certificate has been an active
participant in a significant number of professional development activities and
events. Participation in PhD Plus activities _does not_ require active pursuit
of the certificate—all engineering PhD students are invited to participate in
PhD Plus activities at any time!

### Certificate Requirements

  * **Complete all three Career-Themed Courses**  
\- _One is offered each fall, connected to that year's career-path theme_

  * **Earn all three PhD Plus Career-Themed Badges in Deep Blue**  
\- _For each badge, during its career-themed academic year:_

    * Attend two PhD Plus workshops
    * Complete two PhD Plus skills-based learning sessions
    * Participate in one PhD Plus career conversation
    * Earn 300-plus points in Deep Blue

### How to Access Deep Blue

Use the Suitable app

Students use Duke Deep Blue to track their progress, stay connected, and learn
about upcoming PhD Plus activities.

  * Download the Suitable __ app, for Apple or Android devices.
  * Watch a video on how to use Deep Blue and Suitable » ( _Duke NetID
    required_ )

## Activities and Events

Each semester, PhD Plus provides workshops, skills-based learning sessions,
and career conversations.

Faculty, staff, and alumni contribute to these events to provide PhD students
with enriching, engaging, and highly relevant professional development
experiences.

  * Event details can be found on Deep Blue via the Suitable app
  * Duke engineering PhD students can watch a video about PhD Plus and using
    the app »

## Leadership

PhD Plus is led collaboratively by students, faculty and staff.

All engineering PhD students are encouraged to share feedback and ideas with
the student board members from their home departments.

### How to Join the Advisory Board

  * Students may serve two-year terms on the PhD Plus Advisory Board—and earn
    credit toward their core competency in leadership for their service
  * Each summer, we solicit applications for board membership
  * We aim to have two student representatives from each of the Pratt School
    of Engineering's four academic departments
  * About half of the board seats rotate each academic year
