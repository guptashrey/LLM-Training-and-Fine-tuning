# Pratt Profile: Oscar Carrasco-Zevallos

  * PhD candidate, Biomedical Engineering (Expected Graduation: Spring 2019)
  * Developing novel technologies for retinal surgery and measuring corneal
    tissue with Joseph Izatt

**Where are you from?**

I am from Peru, but I moved to Texas when I was 7.

**What was your undergrad degree and where did you get it?**

I have a BS in biomedical engineering from Texas A&M University.

**Why did you choose Duke?**

I chose Duke mainly because of the professor and research. That’s how I
narrowed down my options, but there were several schools that I was a good
match for in terms of research. Duke came out on top because the labs seemed
very collaborative and willing to help each other out. That made a much less
tense environment, where everyone can get along and there is no cut-throat
competition from your peers.

Duke seemed to really look after their graduate students. There are numerous
functions and events specifically to help graduate students socialize, like
the E-Socials held on the engineering quad every Friday. You do not see much
of that in other schools. Duke is a great school, and I am happy to be here.

**What do you like to do in your spare time?**

I enjoy playing sports, especially soccer. I also enjoy hanging with my
friends at the Sarah P. Duke Gardens. The weather is nice here much of the
time so you can really enjoy the outdoors.

**What organizations are you involved in?**

I am a part of the Optical Society of America and also am active in helping to
recruit minority graduate students to Pratt. We have a number of outreach
events throughout the year, like visiting undergraduate schools and hosting
breakfasts during recruiting season to help prospective students get to know
us better.

**Why would you encourage other students to choose Duke?**

The labs are great. Duke is one of the top schools, but as I mentioned before
it also seems less stressful than other universities. We have a really
friendly and cooperative culture here at Pratt and across the university. This
is a place where you will not only receive a good education, but also have
fun.

**What’s ahead for you after graduation?**

I’d like to become a professor at a top-tier research university.
