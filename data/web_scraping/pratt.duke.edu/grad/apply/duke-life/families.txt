# Families

When you study at Duke, you join the Duke Family. As a community we support
each other and our loved ones. Services available to graduate students
include:

### Child Care Subsidy

The Graduate School at Duke offers full-time PhD students subsidies of up to
$5,000 per year to help cover the cost of enrolling their child/children at a
child-care center or a family child-care home. More Information

### Childbirth and Adoption Accommodations

Duke PhD students are guaranteed time off from full-time graduate studies and
duties after the birth or adoption of a child, to help them transition to
parenthood. More information »

### GradParents Student Group

The GradParents student group is designed to provide additional support,
family-friendly events, and networking opportunities for students in The
Graduate School who are raising children. The group typically holds one or two
off-campus events per semester (such as Disney on Ice or a pumpkin patch) and
quarterly lunches hosted by The Graduate School. More information

### Services for Spouses

#### DukeCard

A spouse of a Duke graduate student may obtain a Duke ID card [known as a
DukeCard]. A DukeCard allows free borrowing from Duke Libraries, and access to
recreational facilities, athletic events and other specified campus locations
and activities.

To obtain a card for a spouse, go to the Office of Information Technology
(OIT) Guest Account website. A small fee applies.

#### International House

partners, both international and U.S., male or female, to their support
network, which includes a mailing list and events.
