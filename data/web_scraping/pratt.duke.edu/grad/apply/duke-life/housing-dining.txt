# Housing & Dining

## Housing Tips

Duke graduate students generally look for housing off campus, in an apartment
or home. Looking for a place to live in a new city can feel daunting. Here are
some helpful tips:

  * Look for living space within a few miles of where you will be taking your
    classes or within walking distance of a Duke Bus stop or a GoDurham bus
    stop. Buses generally stop at least four times an hour during school
    hours.
  * Browse the rooms and properties to rent on the public NearDuke.com and the
    private DukeList [NetID required].
  * Talk to someone on campus about the area you're investigating _before_ you
    sign a lease. Call your department office for advice.
  * Consider space on campus, which is sometimes available for graduate
    students. Get more information here.

## Dining At Duke

There are over 30 great places to dine on Duke's campuses. Duke has been
consistently ranked among the Best Colleges for Food in America. The
Fitzpatrick Center is home to Duke Engineering's own Irish-themed eatery,
Twinnie's.

### Vegetarians and Vegans

Duke offers vegetarian and vegan options at several of its on-campus venues.

### Plans and Points

All Duke eateries take Food Plans and Points with your ID card. Most also take
cash or credit cards.

There are also Durham off-campus restaurants that take Duke points as payment.
