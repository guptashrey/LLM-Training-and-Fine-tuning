### Medical Insurance for Students

While you are a student at Duke, your health is important to us.

All Duke students are required to maintain adequate medical insurance. Duke
offers a Student Medical Insurance Plan (SMIP) designed to meet the needs of
students who have no insurance or who have inadequate coverage.

If you are an international student holding an F1 or J1 visa, enrollment in
the SMIP is mandatory.

Visit the Duke Student Affairs website for more information
