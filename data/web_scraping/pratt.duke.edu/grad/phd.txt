## Duke Cultivates Engineering Leaders

### Mentorship From Day One

Our PhD students receive exceptional technical training and mentorship from
our world-class faculty.

In our laboratories, PhD students become true collaborators, where they co-
invent new solutions and develop entrepreneurial skills.

Visit Duke Engineering Entrepreneurship (EngEn) »

### Authentic Opportunities to Learn Mentorship Through Mentoring

In preparation for your role as a research mentor, Duke Engineering actively
encourages and supports efforts by its PhD students to mentor undergraduates
in research work.

Our PhD students can register to serve as a mentor and post a research project
to a university-wide directory of research opportunities for undergraduates:
Muser.

As mentors, our PhD students build professional mentoring relationships with
undergraduates, while increasing undergraduate involvement in research—one of
the hallmarks of a Duke Engineering education.

### Outstanding Student Support

At Duke, you'll have the advantage of programs that build your communication
and other professional skills.

  * Visit our professional development program, PhD Plus »

### Preparation for a Great Career

About half our PhD graduates join industry—often with leading global
companies. Nearly 40 percent start academic careers, many at the world's
leading research institutions.
