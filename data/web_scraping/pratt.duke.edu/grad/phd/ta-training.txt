# Teaching Assistant Training

Teaching is a skill that you develop as a TA

Teaching is a skill that you will grow and develop during your time at Duke.

As part of that, each Duke Engineering doctoral (PhD) student is required to
be a teaching assistant (TA) in two courses.

PhD students typically fulfill their Teaching Assistant (TA) assignments in
Years 2 through 5. Students attend a TA seminar during the semester in which
they TA, and they complete a TA training session.
