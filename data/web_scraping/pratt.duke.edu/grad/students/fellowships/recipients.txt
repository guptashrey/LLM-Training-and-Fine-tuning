# NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and Major External Fellowship Recipients

The Duke's Pratt School of Engineering encourages graduate students to seek
support from important external fellowships. Earning these competitive
fellowships goes a long way toward helping emerging scientists conduct their
research while raising Duke Engineering’s profile and research portfolio in
turn.

> Duke Engineering has become the choice of recipients of these prestigious
> fellowships

The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program is the oldest graduate fellowship
of its kind in the United States, with a long history of selecting recipients
who achieve high levels of success in their academic and professional careers.

The U.S. Department of Defense offers several prestigious fellowship
opportunities, including the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate
(NSDEG) Fellowship, and the Science, Mathematics And Research for
Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service program.
