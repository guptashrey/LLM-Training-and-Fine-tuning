# An Authentic Design Experience in Your First Year

Duke Engineering students learn to think and work like engineers from the
start

While traditional engineering curricula start off with years of analytical
coursework, in Duke's First-Year Design Program students think and work like
engineers from the start.

In EGR 101L: Engineering Design and Technical Communication, first-year
students work in teams to design, build and deliver prototype solutions to
problems presented by real clients.

Through active, hands-on learning, our students gain technical, communication,
and analytical skills. They become equipped with new skills and gain
inspiration from seeing the impact engineers make. _What is Duke First-Year
Design? »_

> “I came to Duke knowing I wanted to work on medical devices. To have had a
> taste of my dream in my very first semester was very, very exciting."
>
> **Emily Barre** '21 | Now a Medical Student at DUKE

## Real Clients, Real Challenges

First-Year Design teams have worked on solutions for campus institutions like
the **Duke Lemur Center** and the **Duke University School of Nursing**.
They've also tackled challenges faced by **partner companies** and **community
organizations** in North Carolina and beyond.

Summaries of recent projects »

The experience doesn't have to end there. Students may choose to keep working
on their designs in EGR190: Design 2 Deliver. Some teams have even gone on to
win national design competitions—and start the process to patent their
designs.

## Spaces Designed for Creating

##

Our engineering students learn and create in specially designed spaces that
bristle with racks of tools and are packed with rapid prototyping technology.

As Duke students, these innovators and creators also have access to
university-supported maker spaces.

Duke Engineering's new Wilkinson Building is home to innovative "garage labs"
and additional spaces dedicated to design and entrepreneurship education.

## 'I Can Do This'

##

Duke's First-Year Design program was created by nationally recognized
engineering educator Ann Saterbak.

The curriculum introduces new students to the rigor of engineering school—
learning new skills related to calculations, project planning and team
communication.

Research suggests that first-year students who take design courses are more
likely to stay with engineering.

These students have improved self-efficacy—the "I can do it" belief that they
can succeed and meet new challenges.

> "Duke has systematically and energetically refocused our curriculum around
> active, engaging, problem-based research and design projects. This is being
> done particularly well by Duke Engineering."
>
> **Vincent E. Price** |President, Duke University
