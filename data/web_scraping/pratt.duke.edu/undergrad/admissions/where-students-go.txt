## By Discipline

### Where do Biomedical Engineering students go?

Graduates of our biomedical engineering program are prepared for professional
employment in areas such as the medical device industry, engineering
consulting, biomechanics, and biotechnology, graduate work in biomedical
engineering, or entrance into medical and professional schools. About one-
third of our students enter graduate schools in various engineering or basic
science disciplines and one-third are accepted by medical or dental schools.
The rest go to law school, business school, or employment in industry.

### Where do Civil & Environmental Engineering students go?

Civil engineers design modern marvels such as the underground mass transit,
and design buildings capable of safely weathering earthquakes. Environmental
engineers are developing new treatment methods to combat pollution in the air,
water, and soil. These engineers solve complex problems and work to balance
the needs of growing human populations and the environment, addressing the
challenges of pollution, traffic congestion, drinking water, and energy needs,
urban redevelopment and community planning.

### Where do Electrical & Computer Engineering students go?

Electrical and computer engineers are improving television and satellite
transmissions, helping the military detect unexploded bombs, helping us
understand how marine mammals communicate and developing megapixel cameras.
The job opportunities for ECE graduates are limitless. These engineers also
apply their understanding of electricity to make contributions to the field of
medicine, such as improving or developing new analytical tools for doctors or
making cochlear implants for deaf persons more effective in interpreting
sound. Computer engineers can specialize in digital systems, computer
operating systems, networks, software, and hardware.

### Where do Mechanical Engineering students go?

Mechanical engineers work in fields that support the entire spectrum of
consumer products, including robotics, automotive, packaging, and
transportation. They are playing a key role in efforts to develop nano-sized
machines and ultimately, to enable industrial-scale nanomanufacturing.
Mechanical engineers frequently work in areas that cross over into other
disciplines, particularly biology and medicine. For example, mechanical
engineers at Duke are helping to develop artificial tissue and organs, and
novel treatments for cancer and biomedical imaging.
