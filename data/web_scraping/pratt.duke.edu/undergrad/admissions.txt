# Undergraduate Admissions

We know that as a future engineer you will need a place to grow academically,
personally and develop lifelong connections. Here at Duke, we offer these
growth opportunities through four accredited bachelors of engineering degree
programs.

Explore the links below to learn more about our academics, check out the
slideshows to see what makes Duke Engineering special, and then visit the Duke
Undergraduate Admissions site to learn how to apply.

## Six Reasons to be a Duke Engineer

  * #### You'll be part of an inclusive and close-knit community.

Our students have a unique opportunity at Duke to be part of a smaller school
with a commitment to inclusion and a strong sense of community, but still gain
the benefits of being a dynamic part of a larger top-ranked university.
Students receive close faculty interaction, gain a strong sense of teamwork,
and develop lifelong connections.

  * #### You can explore your options.

We encourage new undergraduates to investigate each of our engineering
departments to see what suits them best. We encourage students to seek
interaction with faculty from all engineering departments.

  * #### You can pursue a second major, a minor, or a certificate.

Students are able to combine the arts and sciences, or another engineering
major. Other interests such as pre-med or pre-law are able to be accommodated.

  * #### You can do research as an undergraduate.

We strive to give each undergraduate student an opportunity for hands-on
research experience. We believe this is a critical part of helping students
learn and to find a career. Such research experience makes Pratt students
highly competitive for jobs, graduate school admission and scholarships.

  * #### We encourage you to study abroad.

Students can go to places like England, Australia, Germany, Turkey, France,
and others. We also encourage service learning opportunities—put your new
engineering skills to work where they are needed through programs like Duke
Engineers for International Development and Engineering World Health.

  * #### We want you to learn outside the classroom.

Students have many learning options outside the classroom, including student
groups, clubs, design contests, guest lectures, seminars, and more. We
encourage students to nurture their curiosity by creating opportunities for
exciting, offbeat and even surprising ways to put book learning into practice.

## Take the Tour

Many students come to campus for a walking tour, and you should sign up for
one of those if you can, but first get a taste of the engineering life at Duke
in this tour.

  * #### Hudson Hall is the ancestral home of engineering on Duke's West
    Campus.

  * #### This is the Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering,
    Medicine and Applied Sciences.

FCIEMAS has the longest name and hardest to pronounce acronym on Duke's
campus.

  * #### The Teer Engineering Building is the third in Duke's engineering
    complex.

Pizza delivery folks practically live here, and so does the Dean.

  * #### We know engineers study a lot,

which can make for some pasty complexions, so we designed our study spaces
with lots of natural light.

  * #### Duke Engineers have their own Irish cafe.

Oddly enough, most of the food here is Mediterranean. But they do serve tea.

  * #### At Duke we will teach you how to become an engineer —

with hands on classes from day one.

  * #### No teaching opportunity is too offbeat for us —

these students built vehicles powered by mousetraps.

  * #### How about Olympics with robots you build yourself?

  * #### How about building an ice-skating wheelchair for an avid hockey fan?

  * #### Why not go to Indonesia with your classmates and help a village
    recover from a tsunami through sustainable engineering projects?

  * #### You can work side by side with faculty,

like Grand Challenge Scholar Gift Nyikayaramba.

  * #### But we don't forget the importance of having fun together.

Our engineering student government hosts socials for students and faculty most
Friday afternoons.

  * #### Teaching you to work in teams is one of our top goals.

Think of it as practice for the real world.

  * #### So come to Duke and be a world changing engineer.

Everyone will be glad you came.
