# Katsouleas NAE Grand Challenges Scholars Program

An outstanding learning and research experience

The **Thomas C. Katsouleas National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand
Challenges Scholars Program** seeks leaders with the drive to take on some of
the biggest challenges facing humanity—and want to start while they are still
undergraduates.

It's a unique educational journey:

  * A hands-on project or research experience
  * Innovation and entrepreneurship experience
  * A global dimension and service learning

Each scholar is supported by a faculty member who serves as advisor and
mentor— and each GCS scholar receives up to $5,000 toward the completion of
their portfolio.

> "It’s opened up my eyes to broader systemic injustices, especially racial
> and socioeconomic injustices—not just in the US, but worldwide. I really
> want to work to address those inequities."

## Resources for GC Scholars and Applicants

Students are strongly encouraged to meet with David Schaad to discuss the GCS
application process prior to submitting their online application. Email
david.schaad@duke.edu

### How to Become a Grand Challenges Scholar

  1. Choose 1 of the 14 Grand Challenges as your research focus

  2. Write a brief (300 words or less) Essay describing why you want to be a Grand Challenge Scholar

  3. Submit your online application to become a GCS

**Students must apply before the end of their sophomore year** , however,
students are encouraged to apply early to allow more time to complete their
GCS portfolio. Students interested in the GCS program are encouraged to meet
with David Schaad to discuss the GCS application process prior to submitting
their online application. Email david.schaad@duke.edu for more information
about the application process.

### The Grand Challenge E-Portfolio

The Grand Challenges Portfolio is made up of a variety of classes (including
independent study classes) and experiences that are related to your Grand
Challenge (GC) focus.

These activities must cover five themes and a senior thesis:

  * Research
  * Interdisciplinary curriculum
  * Entrepreneurship
  * Global
  * Service Learning
  * Grand Challenge Scholar Senior Thesis

Research and interdisciplinary curriculum are considered in-depth experiences.
Entrepreneurship, Global, and Service Learning can be "medium" or "minimum"
depth experiences. See description below.

GCS will create an online public e-portfolio to describe and document their
GCS experiences. Students can use WordPress, Pebble Pad or any other online
website/e-portfolio platform.

#### In-Depth Experiences

##### 1\. Research – Student must do in-depth research related to their GC
Focus

  * Guidelines: Three (3) independent study classes or equivalent experiences
    related to the students GC focus.
  * In-Depth Experiences = 400-plus total hours

Examples of in-depth research experiences:

  * Pratt Fellows research
  * Bass Connections project or research
  * Smart Home Fellows research
  * Independent Study research class
  * Engineering World Health (possible Global Experience)
  * Senior design project
  * Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization
  * Graduation with Departmental Distinction research
  * International Honors Program
  * Work in a research lab or on a research project
  * Other similar research experiences

_Note: Your GC Research experiences may also count toward Global,
Entrepreneurial, or Service Learning minimum experiences. See restrictions
below._

##### 2\. Interdisciplinary curriculum – Student must complete in-depth
interdisciplinary curriculum classes related to their GC Focus

  * Guidelines: Three (3) non-engineering (non-research) classes or equivalent
    experiences that are related to the students GC focus
  * In-Depth Experiences = 400-plus total hours

Examples of interdisciplinary curriculum experiences:

  * Non-engineering classes (such as social science and humanities classes)
  * Biology and Natural Science classes generally _do not_ count
  * Bass Connections project
  * Engineering World Health (possible global experience)
  * I&E classes (possible entrepreneurial experience)
  * Other similar interdisciplinary experiences or classes

_Note: Your GC Interdisciplinary experiences may also count as minimum
experiences in Global, Entrepreneurial, or Service Learning areas. See
restrictions below._

#### Medium- and Minimum-Depth Experiences

For the remaining three Components – **Entrepreneurship, Global, and Service
Learning** – one (1) must be at Medium Depth level (or higher) and related to
your GC focus. The other two (2) components can be Minimum Depth (or higher)
and related to any of the 14 GCs.

  * **Medium Depth** is defined as a practicum immersion experience or
    research activity that spans an eight-week summer or a regular semester,
    or one (1) regular semester class or independent study.
  * **Minimum Depth** is defined as a semester or less extra-curricular
    experience such as a volunteer activity, short course, workshop, seminar
    series or conference. Minimum experiences must be thematically linked to
    one of the 14 GC themes that may or may not incorporate the student's GC
    Focus.
  * Either (but not both) of the In-Depth experiences ( **Research or
    Interdisciplinary** ) may directly incorporate the **Entrepreneurial** ,
    **Global** or **Service** learning components and thus can be "double-
    counted" as an additional component depending on the GC Focus, the
    engineering and non-engineering courses taken, the nature of the
    research/project/curriculum, and the extent of engagement.

##### 3\. Entrepreneurship

  * Guidelines: An entrepreneurship experience outside the classroom or lab
    that is related to the students GC focus
  * Entrepreneurship experience can be either Medium or Minimum depth
    experiences. _See guidelines and restrictions above._

Examples of I&E experiences:

  * Participating in the Duke Startup challenge
  * Participating in a Hackathon event
  * Bass Connection projects
  * I&E internship experience
  * Duke in Silicon Valley

##### 4\. Global

  * Guidelines: A Global experience outside the classroom or lab that is
    related to the students GC focus
  * Global experience can be either medium or minimum depth experiences. _See
    guidelines and restrictions above._

Examples of Global experiences:

  * Duke Engage
  * Study Abroad
  * DEID
  * Engineering World Health
  * Smart Home KTH summer research program in Stockholm
  * International conferences or travel experiences

_Note: The Global experience must be conducted outside the student's home
country. For students from the United States of America, the experience should
be outside of North America. For international students, the global experience
should be outside of the USA. The global experience should be a cross-cultural
experience for the student._

##### 5\. Service Learning

  * Guidelines: A Service Learning experience outside of the classroom that
    deepens social awareness and heightens motivation to develop practical
    solutions for society’s problems.
  * Entrepreneurship experience can be either medium or minimum depth
    experiences. _See guidelines and restrictions above._

Examples of Service Learning experiences:

  * Volunteer work
  * Nonprofit organizations
  * Boeing Grand Challenge K-12 Outreach program
  * Student Clubs
  * Engineering World Health
  * DEID

#### 6\. GCS Senior Thesis

To complete the GCS program, students must submit their final GCS Senior
Thesis, which describes their GCS experiences and how these experiences were
related to each other and their GCS focus. The thesis should include a
reflection of how the GCS program added to the student's education and
provided a wide range of experiences which shaped their understanding of the
world and their future.

**The Senior Thesis is due before the end of the last day of class of their
final semester at Duke.**

### Grand Challenge Funding

Students accepted into the GCS program can apply for up to $5,000 in funding,
which can be used to complete their GCS e-portfolio. Students must submit a
completed GCS e-portfolio for approval before receiving GCS funding. At the
end of the GCS program, students must submit a final GCS funding report.
