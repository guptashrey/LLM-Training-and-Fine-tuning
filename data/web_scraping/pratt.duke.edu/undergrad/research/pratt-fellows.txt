# Pratt Research Fellows

A competitive research experience with a summer component

The Pratt Research Fellows Program provides opportunities to do intensive
research over three semesters. Students receive course credit as well as gain
the opportunity for summer research.

Juniors and advanced sophomores are encouraged to apply

Typically, Pratt Fellows graduate with distinction, and with many other
honors. Career goals include medical school or PhD programs at Duke and other
leading research universities.

Applications are accepted in the Fall semester.

## How to Apply

Juniors and advanced sophomores are encouraged to apply.

Attention is given to the recruitment of underrepresented populations in
engineering—women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities.

### Understanding Your Schedule

Students participate in the Pratt Research Fellows program for a total of 4
terms as follows.

#### Traditional:

  * Three (3) independent study semesters. Students earn a total of 3 course
    credits; and
  * 10-week, full-time internship experience on campus during one summer.
    Students receive a stipend of $5000 to cover living expenses incurred
    during their summer research experience.

#### Alternate:

  * Four (4) independent study semesters. Students earn a total of 4 course
    credits.

### Starting the Application

  * Browse available research projects for the Class of 2023-2024
  * Browse samples of possible additional projects in last year's research
    projects
  * Contact and meet with engineering faculty to learn more about their
    projects

### Preparing to Apply

  * Select up to three (6) research projects, and rank them in order of
    preference
  * Request a reference letter from an engineering faculty member

### Submitting Your Application

  * In the research projects section of your application, provide the Project
    Title and the Faculty for each preferred project
