**Year:** Senior

**Major:** Mechanical Engineering

Favorite spot on campus...

The CoLab or the Rubenstein!

Advice I would tell my first-year self...

Focusing on a few clubs/activities that you’re genuinely passionate about is a
lot more beneficial than joining a multitude of organizations that crowd your
schedule.

Resources I love to use at Duke...

Asking for help from other co creators at the CoLab, FLUNCHing my professors,
DTech’s 12Twenty for connecting with current and previous female STEM
students, and hunting for Pat and Eric at Hudson Hall for help.

My favorite class(es) at Duke...

EGR 121: Engineering Design and Innovation, Becky Simmons’s Product Design
Course, and EGR 321 Mechanical Engineering Analysis for Design.

Co-Curricular/Engagement Experiences...

DesignHub at the CoLab, DTech former Community Lead, Street Medicine dance
team, TA for EGR121, Bass Connections, Study Abroad in Madrid, the Benenson
Art Award.

How I like to spend my free time ...

Sketching and getting inspiration from Pinterest, making posters on
Illustrator, designing random 3D printed parts at the CoLab

How I decided on my major...

Im most passionate about the intersection of visual arts and engineering. I
see Duke's ME program as a great means to fuse my two passions together
through various interdisciplinary and collaborative projects. I chose ME
specifically to gain a better understanding of physical and mechanical designs
to design better, more innovative, and more functional products for consumers.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
