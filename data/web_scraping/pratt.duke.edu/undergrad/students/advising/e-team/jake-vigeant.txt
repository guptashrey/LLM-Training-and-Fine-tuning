**Year:** Junior

**Major:** Biomedical Engineering

Favorite spot on campus...

I love hitting the driving range at WaDuke and Wilson Gym to de-stress
whenever I can.

Advice I would tell my first-year self...

Before you commit your time to anything, make sure to have a working calendar
of all your responsibilities. This is helpful in avoiding conflicts and
ensuring there is a manageable workload for each day. Also, ensure you budget
the time for some personal growth/enjoyment activities each day outside of
schoolwork.

Resources I love to use at Duke...

The Career Center people are super friendly and really have pointed me in the
right academic directions for my long-term goals so far. The Co-Lab has been a
powerhouse for working on my personal engineering projects as well.

My favorite class(es) at Duke...

I really enjoyed EGR101 and CS201 for the technical skills I learned. Would
also highly recommend Econ 174 for both the humanities credit and introduction
into how companies work!

Co-Curricular/Engagement Experiences...

I have been involved in computer science sidekicks so far, where I tutor
middle school kids from Durham on computer science each week. Outside of that,
I am pursuing a variety of personal engineering projects, including getting
familiar with AI techniques and a startup company. I also have a job working
in the OIT office.

How I like to spend my free time...

I love to do pretty much anything outside, but my favorites are golf and pick-
up sports.

How I decided on my major...

I have always been curious about how computers can produce interactive
applications and software, all while being built from simple wire and metal
connections. Computer Engineering and computer science provide a look into
what happens inside a computer to make the tools we use daily possible.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
