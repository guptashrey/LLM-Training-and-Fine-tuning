# Graduation with Distinction

Each department within the Pratt School of Engineering offers students the
opportunity to Graduate with Departmental Distinction.

This is essentially a senior thesis project, requiring research conducted
through an independent study project, and a written and oral presentation,
although specific departmental requirements for the written and oral
presentation will vary.

This program is an opportunity for students to conduct independent research
under the guidance of supportive faculty members who are leaders in their
field. Confirmation of Graduation with Departmental Distinction is awarded by
vote of the appropriate engineering department.

To be considered for Graduation with Departmental Distinction, an engineering
student must:

  * Have a minimum 3.5 GPA, _and_
  * Successfully complete a significant Independent Study project in his or
    her senior year

Departmental requirements for an oral presentation and written report vary.
However, the results of the research project must be summarized in a formal
written report and defended in an oral presentation before a committee of
faculty members.

  * For more information, contact your academic department's director of

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
