# The First Year

Welcome to your first year as a Duke Engineer!

This will be an exciting year—

**In the classroom and lab** , you will be immersed in real-world, hands-on
design. And, you'll begin your training in computing and data science,
chemistry, mathematics and physics. You will grow critical-thinking skills and
develop important communication skills.

**Just as important** , we'll start a sustained conversation about your sense
of purpose.

**Plus** , we've designed experiences and provided support that will help
build your motivation to become an engineer who makes a difference in the
world.

  * All about Duke's First-Year Design Experience

## Components of the First Year

  * Duke Engineering's signature First-Year Curriculum
  * The First-Year Design Experience
  * 360 Advising
  * Coaching Fellows and Peer Advisors
  * Opportunities to explore and engage topics important to you

## The First-Year Curriculum

Fall Semester

  * First-Year Design EGR 101 _Note 3_
  * Mathematics 111L
  * Chemistry 101DL _Note 2_
  * Digital Computation ( _some may be assigned to Writing 101_ ) _Note 4_

Spring Semester

  * Mathematics 112L
  * Physics 151L
  * Technical Course _Note 5_
  * Writing 101 ( _Digital Computation for those assigned to Writing 101 in
    the Fall_ ) __Note 4_  
_

__This table assumes no AP or IPC credit_ _Note 1__

#### Important Notes

#### 1\. If You Have AP or IPC Credit

Students with credit for:

  * **AP Math** should consult the AP table and Department of Mathematics
    placement guidelines to determine appropriate math course placement
  * **AP Computer Science** should take CS 201 Data Structures and Algorithms
    to satisfy the engineering Digital Computation requirement.

Students without AP Computer science credit should take EGR 103L Computational
Methods.

Email **pratt-advising@duke.edu** for assistance interpreting such credit as
it pertains to course selection.

#### 2\. Chemistry Placement

  * Students _without_ AP Chemistry credit should enroll in CHEM 101DL
  * Students who plan to major in Civil Engineering (CE), Electrical and
    Computer Engineering (ECE), Environmental Engineering (EnvE) or Mechanical
    Engineering (ME) have satisfied the chemistry requirement with a score of
    4 or 5 on the AP Chemistry exam
  * Students who plan to major in Biomedical Engineering (BME), and received
    an AP Chemistry exam:
    * **Score of 5** —Should enroll in CHEM 201DL
    * **Score of 4** —Should enroll in CHEM 101DL or CHEM 110DL

See chemistry placement guidelines »

Contact pratt-advising@duke.edu for guidance on appropriate chemistry
placement.

#### 3\. All First-Year students take Design and Digital Computation Courses

**All first-year Duke Engineering students** take:

  * First-Year Design (EGR 101L Engineering Design and Communication) in the
    fall or spring semester
  * A Digital Computation course. _See_Note 1 _for information about which
    course to select to satisfy this requirement_

#### 4\. Writing 101

  * Students assigned to Writing 101 in the Fall should enroll in a writing
    section
  * Students not assigned to Writing 101 in the Fall should enroll in a
    Digital Computation course

#### 5\. Suggested First Technical Courses

The technical course in your first spring semester should be selected
according to your intended major, if known:

  * **Undecided—** Biology 201L or one of the classes listed below
  * **Biomedical Engineering—** Biology 201L
  * **Civil Engineering—** CEE 132L
  * **Electrical & Computer Engineering—**ECE 110L
  * **Environmental Engineering—** CEE 132L
  * **Mechanical Engineering—** EGR 121L
