# Academic Dismissal

A Duke student can be involuntarily withdrawn for academic reasons, financial
reasons, and for violation of academic regulations. The information in this
section pertains to involuntary withdrawal for academic reasons.

You will be withdrawn involuntarily from Duke for academic reasons if:

  * at the end of a semester you fail to pass at least three courses (3.0
    credits) that semester, except that in the first semester of enrollment at
    Duke, you must pass at least two courses (2.0 credits);
  * you fail more than one full (1.0 credit) course in a summer session at
    Duke;
  * you are on probation and at the end of your probationary semester, you
    have failed to earn grades of C- or better in each of the four courses
    completed that semester or a C average for that semester; or
  * before the beginning of any fall term, you have not met annual
    continuation requirements.

A second academic dismissal will result in a minimium separation of two years
(including summers).

For information about returning from an Academic Dismissal, you should consult
the Time Away website.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
