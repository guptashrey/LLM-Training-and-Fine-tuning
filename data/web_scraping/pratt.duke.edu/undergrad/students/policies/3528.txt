# Schedule Correction Period

When the Drop/Add period ends, you have one week in which to review your
course schedule and make any necessary corrections (for a current list of
important dates, see Course Change Deadlines).

Any withdrawal from a course after Drop/Add ends will result in the assignment
of a grade of W to the course in question. After the correction period ends
you may no longer add a course for any reason.

**It is therefore critical that you review your course schedule carefully
every semester at the end of drop/add to be sure you are actually enrolled in
the courses you're attending.**

**Note: You may not add a course during the Schedule Correction Period that
you did not attend before the end of drop/add.**

If you have been attending a course since before the end of drop/add, and it
does not appear on your schedule, you must obtain written permission and
confirmation of the dates on which you've attended from the instructor. You
must then take this written material to your Academic Dean.

If you have not attended a course since the end of drop/add, but it does
appear on your schedule, see Academic Deans immediately. Failure to withdraw
may result in a failing grade.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
