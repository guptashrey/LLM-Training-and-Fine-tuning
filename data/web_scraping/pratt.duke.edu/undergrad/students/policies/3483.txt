*A few notes: Some courses (e.g., BIO 201L, ECON 201D, MATH 202, 212, 221, and
PHYSICS) have additional pre-requisites that you will need to have before you
can enroll. Pre-requisites are listed on Class Detail page for each course. AP
credit in English does not exempt any student from WRITING 101. History majors
may count one AP credit in History toward the major.

**(a)BIOLOGY:** Must have earned Chem 21, 101DL or 110DL credit in order to
enroll in BIO 201L.

**(c)COMPSCI:** AP credit only applies to students in Trinity College. No
credit is awarded for Engineering students and will not count toward the
Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. Credit may be used for placement.

**(d)MATHEMATICS:** Students who are interested in economics and social
sciences and who are confident they will not pursue math, physics, chemistry,
or engineering may take Math 202 instead of Math 212. See
math.duke.edu/undergraduate/course-placement for discussion of placement.
Note: AP credit in MATH was changed for the class entering in Fall 2016 (a
score of 3 on BC exam no longer provides credit and a score of 4 gives credit
for only Math 21).

**(e)PHYSICS:** In Trinity College, prospective Physics and Biophysics majors
are strongly encouraged to take at least PHYSICS 162L independent of their AP
course credit. In the Pratt School of Engineering, at least ONE Physics course
must be taken post-matriculation to satisfy the Physics requirement in the
Engineering curriculum. Students receiving the AP credits for PHY 25 and 26
must: a)take a Duke Physics course at or above PHY 153L; b) decline the AP
credit for PHY 26 and take PHY 152L; or c) decline both AP credits and take
PHY 151L and 152L.

**(f)STATISTICS:** AP credit only applies to students in Trinity College. No
credit is awarded for Engineering students and will not count toward the
Bachelor of Science degree.

In order to have your AP credits placed on your Duke record/transcript, you
must have the AP Service send your scores to the Office of the Registrar at
Duke. To send scores to Duke, contact AP Exams, CN6671, Princeton, NJ
08541-6671;apscore.collegeboard.org/scores; 609-771-7300 or 888-225-5427.
Duke's CEEB number is 5156.

##### International Placement Credit

Duke also recognizes international standardized examinations and confers a
limited amount of elective credit and placement into advanced courses at Duke
for students whose performance in these examinations meets certain standards
established by the University. If you completed one of the exams below, the
required score for the credit is listed.

Examination Score  
International Baccalaureate 6 or 7 on the higher level*  
Cambridge Pre-U M3 or higher  
Caribbean Advance Proficiency Exam (CAPE) 1 or 2  
British, Hong Kong or Singapore A-level (GCE) A or B  
French Baccalaureate 14 or higher  
Swiss Maturite 4 or 5  
German Abitur 10 or higher  
All India/Delhi Senior School Certificate Exam (Class 12) 84 or higher  
Indian School Certificate Exam (12th year) 84 or higher  
Higher Secondary Certificate Exam (India, 12th year) 84 or higher  
Israeli Matriculation Certificate (5 units only) 75 or higher  
International Advanced Level (IAL) Exam A or B  
  
_*Duke no longer accepts IB Higher Level Physics or Spanish credit due to a
change in the IB curriculum for both of those exams. The content no longer
meets the minimum standards._

Duke credits can be awarded only in those subject areas for which there is an
AP exam offered domestically (see previous table of this section. Have the
scores of your examinations sent directly to the Office of the University
Registrar (Box 10484, Durham, NC 27708) as soon as you can, so that credit can
be posted to your Duke record. If you have any difficulties with this, contact
Harry Nelson in the Registrar's Office to ask for clarification or further
instructions. If you have questions about the use of IPC for placement into
Duke courses, contact an academic dean or the appropriate department.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
