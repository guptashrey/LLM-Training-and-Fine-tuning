# Probation

You will be placed on "Probation" for a semester if you accumulate a certain
number of D and F grades. See the section on grades for a detailed listing of
grades and outcomes. A semester of probation is designed to serve as a "wake-
up" call. It is a sign that you are in imminent danger of being withdrawn from
Duke for academic reasons.

Students with poor grades in the fall will be placed on probation in the
spring. Students with poor grades in the spring will be placed on probation in
the fall. If, due to exceptional circumstances, you petition for and are
permitted to withdraw from a course to an underload during your semester of
probation, your probationary status will be automatically extended to the next
semester. Parent(s)/guardian(s) are notified of probationary status.
Probationary information is not placed on your official transcript.

If your semester academic record warrants probation you will receive
notification from one of your Academic Deans:

  * You must meet with a Dean
  * You must acknowledge your probation in writing by signing an
    acknowledgment form. Failure to sign the acknowledgment form by the end of
    the first week of class will result in dismissal
  * You must enroll in four and only four full credit (1.0 credit) courses for
    the semester of probation
  * Your courses must be approved by a Dean
  * At the end of the probationary semester, if you maintain a C (2.0) average
    or you have no grade lower than a C- for the semester, you will clear
    probation. If you fail to clear probation, you will be academically
    withdrawn from Duke for two semesters. Regardless of probation, you must
    still meet all continuation requirements

If you are placed on probation, you should take the time to address your
strengths and weaknesses in study skills and habits and also identify problems
that have disrupted your academic program. You should institute changes
wherever appropriate. We urge you to confer with your Academic Deans, Advisor,
Instructor, a counselor at CAPS, or with a member of the staff of the Academic
Resource Center, as appropriate, early in the semester of probation.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
