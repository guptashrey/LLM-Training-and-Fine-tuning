# Dean's List and Dean's List with Distinction

When determining a student's eligibility, Duke will consider only grades
earned in Duke courses, including those earned in Duke Study Abroad programs
and in courses covered by the Interinstitutional Agreement.

To qualify for Dean's List, a Pratt undergraduate must fulfill the following
criteria:

  1. Carry a normal academic load including four credits other than dance performances/technique, physical education activity, music activity, and house courses;
  2. Earn grades other than a "S" in at least three semester courses;
  3. Receive no incomplete or failing grades;
  4. Earn a semester grade point average that is placed in the highest one third of undergraduates in Pratt.

For Dean's List and Dean's List with Distinction GPA requirements, click here.

For information about Graduation With Departmental Distinction, click here.

**SPECIAL NOTE FOR SPRING 2020 - Changes in academic policy due to COVID-19
have caused the suspension of identifying Dean's List and Dean's List with
Distinction for Spring 2020.**

**SPECIAL NOTE FOR FALL 2020 & SPRING 2021 - Continued pandemic conditions
have caused the suspension of identifying Dean's List and Dean's List with
Distinction for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.**

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
