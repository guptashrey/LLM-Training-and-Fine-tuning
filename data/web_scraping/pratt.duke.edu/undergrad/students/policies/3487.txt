# Complaints About a Course

It is the obligation of your instructors to evaluate your course work and to
submit a grade for you at the end of the academic semester. You, in turn, have
a right to know at the beginning of the semester the basis on which you will
be evaluated in a course and to expect to be graded fairly, i.e., in the same
way that all other students in a course are graded.

If you have concerns or complaints about a course in which you are enrolled,
you should try to resolve the matter with the instructor. If your concern is
not resolved to your satisfaction in this way, you can bring it to the
attention of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and if necessary to the
Department Chair, in accordance with the Undergraduate Grade Review Procedure.
You may also find it helpful to speak with Academic Deans about your rights
and responsibilities.

**Note:** A fuller statement called "Procedures for Resolution of Student's
Academic Concerns" is found in the _Duke Community Standard in Practice: A
Guide for Undergraduates_.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
