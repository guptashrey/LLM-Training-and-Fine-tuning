# Dropping a Course

The first two weeks of every semester are known as the Drop/Add Period. During
the first week of class, you can use DukeHub online to add a course if there
are seats available. Check the course listings on DukeHub and be sure that you
check for prerequisites that might be required for the course. During the
second week, you can still add a course, but you will need to obtain a
permission number from the instructor of the course you want to add. You'll
use the permission number when you add the course through DukeHub. No
permission number is necessary during the first week unless enrollment in a
specific course is by permission only.

After the end of the Drop/Add period, you can no longer add a new course. The
only exception would be if you needed to correct your schedule in the week
after Drop/Add (the Schedule Correction Period). You should always review your
schedule as soon as the Drop/Add Period is over every semester to be sure
you're enrolled in the correct courses.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
