# Class Attendance and Missed Work

By Pratt School of Engineering policy, you are expected to and should attend
classes regularly and complete all assignments on time. Class attendance is
critical for many reasons and is often a factor in determining the course
grade. This is particularly true of lab courses. Most instructors state their
attendance policy in the course syllabus or in the first class session. Be
sure you understand what each of your instructors expects of you. If you must
miss a class, it's a good idea to let your instructor know in advance or as
soon thereafter as possible. If you don't explain your absence, your
instructor may assume you don't care about the class or your grade.

The information below details policies and procedures dealing with missed work
related to class absence. It is important to note that these policies and
procedures do not apply during the reading and final exam period.

Missed work associated with absence from class is accommodated in three
circumstances (see below). The nature of the accommodation (e.g. arrangements
made to submit work early, alternative assignment, etc) is to be determined by
the faculty member.

### 1\. Illness or other extraordinary personal circumstance:

  * Short-term illness: Students notify their instructors and their Academic
    Deans by means of the Short-Term Illness Notification Form that they are
    temporarily incapacitated and hence are unable to attend class or complete
    an assignment on time. They submit the STINF on their honor, and
    instructors are expected to accept students’ pledges that they are
    incapacitated. Students are expected to submit the form as soon as
    possible to the instructor, but depending upon the circumstances, may not
    always be able to do so prior to the date of a missed class or assignment.

  * Extraordinary long-term medical or personal circumstances: In cases of
    long-term or chronic illness/injury or extraordinary personal reasons
    known to and approved by the dean, the student’s academic dean will send
    an e-mail notice to the student’s instructors authorizing the student’s
    absence and requesting accommodation.

### 2\. Religious observance:

  * Students absent from class due to observance of a religious holiday are
    expected to submit a Religious Observance Notification Form to the
    instructor no later than one week prior to the date of the holiday.
    Because religious holidays are scheduled in advance, instructors have the
    right to insist that course work to be missed should be completed prior to
    an anticipated absence in accordance with the course attendance policy.

### 3\. Varsity athletic participation:

  * Varsity athletes, whose athletic travel schedules are governed by strict
    NCAA rules that apply across all varsity sports and all divisional
    schools, are recognized as officially representing the University in
    intercollegiate competitions away from campus. Accordingly, varsity
    athletes are expected to notify instructors at the beginning of the
    semester of their status and submit a Notification of Varsity Athletic
    Participation Form **no later than one week prior to their participation
    in each varsity athletic competition out of town.** Because varsity
    athletic events out of town are scheduled in advance, instructors have the
    right to insist that course work to be missed should be completed prior to
    an anticipated absence in accordance with the course attendance policy.

Missed work associated with any other absence is not covered by this policy.
Students, however, are encouraged to discuss any absence planned or unexpected
with their instructor to determine whether accommodation is possible.
Instructors are not obligated to accommodate such absences but are expected to
make clear in their attendance policy the implications of any such absence.

## Before You Ask an Academic Dean ...

An Academic Dean is an excellent resource for all Pratt undergrads, and you
should not hesitate to contact them for an appointment.

But before you do that, check to see if your question is already answered in
the policies and procedures section.
