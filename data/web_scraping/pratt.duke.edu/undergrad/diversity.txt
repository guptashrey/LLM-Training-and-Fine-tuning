# Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion make for better engineers—and a better experience for
engineering students.

That’s why Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering embraces diversity and inclusion
in the classroom and in the laboratory—whether that’s racial, ethnic, sexual
or gender diversity. Learn more about our commitment to diversity, equity and
inclusion.

Duke Engineering is proud to be part of the American Society of Engineering
Education’s (ASEE) Deans Diversity Initiative. We have earned the Bronze Award
from the ASEE Diversity Recognition Program, and its recommendation as a
national exemplar.
