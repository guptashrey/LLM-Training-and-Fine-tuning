# Duke Engineering Through the Years

## 1887

  * Courses in civil and mining engineering are first offered at Trinity
    College, which would later become Duke University.

## 1924

  * In the Indenture of Trust establishing Duke University, James B. Duke
    names an engineering school as one of the components he wished to
    eventually be included in the new university.

## 1927

  * Civil Engineering (CE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) departments are
    established at Duke University.
  * Classrooms and labs are located in the Asbury and Bivins building on East
    Campus, and engineering students live in Southgate Hall (a.k.a "The
    Shack").

## 1928

  * Duke instates a Bachelor of Science degree for engineers. It requires 138
    semester hours (compared to 126 for the BA degree).

## 1930s

  * Annual "Engineers' Show" becomes a popular event at Duke and in the Durham
    community. Featuring student-organized displays of technological marvels
    such as television, manmade lighting, a working model of a water
    filtration plant and a Mystifier revealing people's exact height and
    weight.
  * It attracts thousands of visitors a year over the next few decades.

## 1931

  * Mechanical Engineering (ME) department is established.

## 1937

  * Departments of CE, EE, and ME are administratively grouped to form the
    Division of Engineering.

## 1939

  * Duke University trustees authorize the creation of a College of
    Engineering. It becomes the third undergraduate college at the young
    university, joining Trinity College and the Woman’s College.
  * William H. Hall becomes the first dean of engineering.
  * Five new engineering professors come on board, nearly doubling the size of
    the faculty to a total of 12.

## 1940

  * Engineering Student Government Society publishes the first issue of Duke
    Engineer (renamed DukEngineer in 1941). The mimeographed magazine was
    dedicated to the happenings in Duke's engineering departments, alumni news
    and student society activities. DukEngineer is student-run and published
    yearly to this day. View the digital archive >

## 1967

  * Division of Biomedical Engineering (BME) is founded by Duke’s Engineering
    and Medical Schools “to train people for a new profession which requires
    more knowledge about medicine than is possessed by the average engineer
    and more knowledge in engineering than is possessed by the average
    doctor,” according to the Durham _Herald-Sun_.

    having to make a single incision in the patient.

## 2003

  * Joseph Izatt's BME research group demonstrates more than 100-fold
    improvement in the sensitivity of **Optical Coherence Tomography** (OCT)
    biomedical imaging technology, which he helped develop for imaging
    delicate structures of the eye while at MIT.
  * Lawrence Carin, Lesie Collins and other Duke electrical and computer
