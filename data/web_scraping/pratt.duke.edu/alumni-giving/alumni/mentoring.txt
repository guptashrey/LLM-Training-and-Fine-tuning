# Alumni-Student Mentorship Program

Make a positive impact on the career path of a Duke Engineering student

Alumni mentors help students set up for success after graduation.

The Pratt Alumni-Student Mentorship Program was developed by the Engineering
Alumni Council to:

  * Connect current students with alumni working in their fields of interest
  * Help students build professional skills and networks
  * Re-connect alumni to the Pratt School of Engineering

Become a Mentor

> “Being able to help students has been incredibly life-giving to me. I am
> glad that I can use the lessons of some of my successes and more
> importantly, my failures, to help them get ready for lives outside of Duke.
> I look forward to seeing how far they will go!”
>
> **Caleb Duncanson** | Class of 2012

## Program Summary

The mentorship process is structured but flexible. It allows for progressive
development of the mentor-mentee relationship.

We recommend that students and alumni communicate at least once every other
month (e.g., email, phone/video call, whatever's easiest for the pair), but
alumni should be available to provide more frequent guidance as needed.
Engagement can range from scheduled video chats to email check-ins to quick
phone calls that address one-off questions.

The EAC strives to bring students and alumni together to benefit the Pratt
community as a whole. Amid the chaos and difficulty of the past year, and
uncertainty of the next, we believe that dedicating time and conversation is
the best form of giving back.

## Expectations

The mentoring program runs each academic year from December through the end of
the spring semester. Students initiate the first communication.

Throughout the academic year, the EAC communicates with mentor/mentee
participants to share pairing information, program guidelines, check-in
reminders and requests for feedback as the year wraps up.

### Student mentees will:

  * Participate in at least three sessions with your mentor
  * Use clear, concise, and responsive communication with your mentor
  * Maintain a professional relationship with your mentor
  * Appropriately represent the Pratt School of Engineering and Duke
    University

### Alumni mentors will:

  * Participate in at least three sessions with your mentee
  * Be a role model and provide acceptance, encouragement, and moral support
  * Share career and job experience while highlighting important industry and
    sector trends
  * Facilitate professional development and encourage your mentee to seek
    appropriate knowledge and resources
