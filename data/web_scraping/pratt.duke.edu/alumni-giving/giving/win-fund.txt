# WIN Empowerment Fund

Making direct and positive impacts in the lives of our students

Financial aid doesn't typically cover the expenses students face when they
make their first big career step—including applying to graduate school and
entering the job market.

WIN Empowerment Fund makes direct and positive impacts on the lives of
financial-aid-receiving students by helping meet those expenses—such as
graduate exam and application fees, and professional attire.

The fund was created through the generosity of the Pratt School of Engineering
group within the Duke Women's Impact Network (WIN), whose mission is to
encourage leadership and philanthropy among women, and the Friends of WIN.
