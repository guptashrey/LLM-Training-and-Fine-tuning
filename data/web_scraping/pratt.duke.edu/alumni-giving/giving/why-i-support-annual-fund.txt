# Why I Support the Engineering Annual Fund

As the Pratt School of Engineering school grows, the Engineering Annual Fund’s
importance grows with it

The strength of the Annual Fund fuels that growth—and each gift, no matter the
size, makes an impact.

> “I have been proud to support the Annual Fund every year because I have seen
> firsthand that it is critically important to Pratt. Those unrestricted
> dollars allow the dean to direct funds to support strategic priorities as
> well as create new programs, such as the new First-Year Design Course and
> Grand Challenge Scholars Program. Both have been extremely successful and
> greatly enhanced the student experience. Pratt has developed a reputation
> among students, faculty and peers for being receptive to new ideas,
> encouraging collaboration with other Duke departments, and being nimble in
> responding to advances in technology and education. The Annual Fund allows
> Pratt to lead the way in this kind of innovative engineering education.”

"I give to the Engineering Annual Fund to help students who may not have the
financial means to attend Duke. I want them to have the same opportunity that
I had to live out my dreams of attending Duke and graduating with a degree in
biomedical engineering. Since becoming an alumna, I have enjoyed interacting
with current students and helping them to navigate the different areas that
they can take their career. I have had a non-traditional career path in that I
went into technology consulting instead of being a practicing engineer.
Because of this, I am able to share the story of my career with them and show
that there are alternative career paths."

> “My own feeling is that unrestricted, current-use giving is the most
> impactful form of support that I can provide to Pratt. Those dollars have an
> immediate impact on the university, and even more importantly, they give our
> team on the field the ability to prioritize what's most important to their
> mission in the current moment. I personally don't have the context, nor the
> expertise, to make those capital allocations, so I prefer to save a
> meaningful portion of my Duke giving for the Annual Fund.”

“I have chosen to support the Engineering Annual Fund because of how important
my Duke education and undergraduate experience remain to me today. After
participating in my 20th Duke reunion as a co-chair last year, I was reminded
of how fortunate I was to attend Duke, and how much it shaped me as a person.
Reconnecting with my friends and classmates was not only incredibly fun, it
was also truly inspiring; so many of them are world-class professionals and
leaders in their chosen fields. Returning to campus after nearly a decade also
proved quite powerful, as the University has continued to grow and expand the
already amazing Gothic wonderland! In addition to my gratitude for the
foundational life experience Duke provided me, I'm also thrilled and inspired
by Dean Bellamkonda's leadership of the engineering school. His focus on
training engineering undergrads to be dynamic leaders in our increasingly
multidisciplinary world has really resonated with me and my own career
journey. My appreciation for Duke grows stronger each year, as does my desire
to both contribute toward and participate in its continued growth and
success."

> “I’ve supported the Pratt Annual Fund for over 15 years—since I joined the

> innovation and excellence that Pratt offers to our students, faculty, and
> staff. We are truly a community, and communities need financial support to
> achieve and to thrive. So it may seem a bit circular, but I vote my wallet,
> and my vote goes to Pratt. And I vote with my heart as my son graduated from
> Pratt this May!”

“It’s been amazing to see and follow the progress at Duke Engineering over the
years. It’s hard to say which part of my Duke experience has been the most
important—the learning, the challenge, the people—they’ve all been so
formative in my life. It’s been a privilege to stay connected as Pratt has
evolved from ‘Old Red’ to the amazing facilities, faculty and resources we
enjoy today as a world-class engineering institution!”

> in people's lives.”
