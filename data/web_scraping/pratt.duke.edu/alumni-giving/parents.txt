# Pratt Parent Circle

A giving club for our most involved non-alumni parents

Parent Circle Members support the Duke Engineering Annual Fund—one of the
easiest and more effective ways to make a real impact on a student’s Duke
experience.

The Annual Fund supports many things, including:

  * High-impact, hands-on education, such as EGR 101: First-Year Design
  * Mentoring programs for undergraduates, such as the 360 Coaching Fellows
    Initiative
  * And more

> Since our daughter started at Duke, we have been impressed with the world-
> class experience she has received, in and out of the classroom. She has a
> wonderful group of Duke friends that we imagine will be lifelong
> relationships. We are non-alumni parents who have enjoyed our own Duke
> experience. It’s wonderful to be part of the Pratt Family!
>
> **Carol Blacutt-Underwood & Brian Underwood**

## Features and Benefits

In addition to supporting the critical Annual Fund, you will also be invited
to exclusive events—such as:

  * The Pratt Parent Circle Meet & Greet during Family Weekend
  * Meetings with the Vinik Dean of Engineering
  * Gatherings with other leaders at the Pratt School of Engineering

Please join Carol and Brian, Nicky and Denis, and many other non-alumni
parents in the Pratt Parent Circle!

> “Our son will leave Pratt well prepared for industry, with a solid
> foundation of problem-solving skills. His rigorous academic schedule is
> balanced by a fun and engaging campus life. And, we get to enjoy our own
> Duke experience with the Pratt Parent Circle—it’s been terrific to meet
> other parents of Duke Engineering students!”
>
> **Nicky & Denis Ziman P’25**

## How to Join
