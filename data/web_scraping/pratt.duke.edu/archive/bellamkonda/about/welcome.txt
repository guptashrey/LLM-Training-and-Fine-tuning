# Dean's Welcome

Welcome to Duke Engineering!

We appreciate your interest in the Pratt School of Engineering and look
forward to sharing our **outrageously ambitious** vision for defining the
future of engineering at Duke.

We are a leading engineering school set in one of the world’s top research
universities. Here, faculty and students work collaboratively to solve global
challenges and make the world a better place—whether by improving human
health, working toward a more resilient and sustainable environment,
discovering new materials or advancing data analytics, computing and
intelligent systems.

> Our award-winning faculty care not only about what they teach but also how
> they teach and what they teach to fuel student curiosity and open new
> horizons. Nearly 70 percent of our undergraduate students conduct faculty-
> mentored research, while our graduate students are routinely recognized at a
> national level for their collaborative and original work.

In the rich environment of Duke Engineering, students can also discover and
develop their passions for entrepreneurship, global outreach, team leadership
and more—and go on to become leaders in industry, academia, medicine, and
other professional pursuits.

No matter what inspires you here, you’ll find that Duke Engineering is a
community vested in your success. We value the different perspectives and
backgrounds our faculty, staff, and students bring to our community, and our
secret to success is in empowering our talented students and faculty to
discover themselves, learn, and to express themselves fully to positively
impact the world.

In 1984, Duke President Terry Sanford famously described the “outrageous
ambitions” propelling Duke University's rise and rapid advance along the path
of excellence. Our goals for Duke Engineering are very much in this dynamic
Duke spirit. In undergraduate and graduate education, in research, in
entrepreneurship and in service, we’re committed to leading boldly to shape
this technological era by creating an environment that enables our community
to achieve great things, and yes—be outrageously ambitious!

You’ll find inspiring examples throughout our website of how our faculty,
graduate students and undergraduates are dreaming big, acting boldly and
making a difference in the world. I hope you’ll enjoy learning more about Duke
Engineering and welcome you to contact us if you have any questions.

With best wishes,

**Prof. Ravi V. Bellamkonda**  
Vinik Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering
