# Maclin Endowment Fund

Helping Duke Engineering students with unexpected educational costs not
covered by financial aid

Traditional financial aid covers the larger higher education costs but does
not typically provide for the many small unforeseen costs that arise between
matriculation and graduation.

Plus, traditional aid may not be responsive or flexible enough to help
students take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.

The fund was created through the generosity of Valecia Maclin E’92. The vision
of the Maclin Endowment Fund is that no eligible Pratt School of Engineering
undergraduate should miss out on educational growth because of costs not
covered by financial aid.

The fund is aimed to support Duke students who are members of the National
Society of Black Engineers but is open to all Pratt School of Engineering
students receiving financial aid.

## WHAT THE FUND COVERS

  * Professional attire for interviews
  * Graduate exam preparation materials and courses
  * Graduate exam fees
  * Graduate, professional and medical school application fees
  * Monetary gaps between Financial Aid Package and Family Contribution
  * Computer issues that directly impact academics
  * Travel for:
    * Interviews
    * Research conference presentations
    * Networking with employers and graduate schools at qualified professional society meetings
    * Study abroad

_NOTE: This is not a complete list. If you have an education-related request
that is not listed above, you are still strongly encouraged to apply._

* * *

## ELIGIBILITY

  * Applications may be submitted by any undergraduate student at Duke who is:
    * Studying engineering, and
    * Receiving financial aid
  * Students with the highest financial need, as determined by Duke's Karsh
    Office of Undergraduate Financial Support, will receive priority
  * The Maclin Endowment Fund provides support for needs remaining after
    available discounts and fee waivers
