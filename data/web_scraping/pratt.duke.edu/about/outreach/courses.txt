# Service-Learning Courses in Engineering

Learning through creating solutions for neighbors in need

Our commitment to engineering in service to society extends to how we train
the next generation of engineers.

A quarter of Duke Engineering students take at least one course, from any part
of Duke, in which they engage in a minimum of 20 hours of planned service
activities integrated with the academic subject matter.

As detailed below, Duke Engineering offers courses in which students learn
while working sensitively and ethically with community clients to design
solutions with impact.

## EGR 101L: Engineering Design and Communication

Developing problem-solving skills by working with real-world clients

All Duke Engineering first-year students take this course as part of our
signature undergraduate experience. It teaches the engineering design process
and builds student self-efficacy through the designing of solutions to
challenges faced by clients in the community.

Students work in teams to understand their client's problem, investigate
potential solutions, and build prototypes. The teams work in the Duke
Engineering Design Pod and The Foundry—well-equipped "maker spaces" stocked
with tools and prototyping technologies.

### Previous Student Projects

  * Shock-absorbing cart to transfer rare books and manuscripts
  * Custom eating utensils for a girl with neuromuscular impairments
  * Tree-based feeding device for aye-ayes at the Duke Lemur Center

## BME 230L: Global Women's Health Technologies

Using human-centered design to address underserved community challenges

This course explores the intersection of technology, women’s health and global
poverty. Student teams work closely with a community representative to
identify a need related to light in a low-resource setting, and then use the
human-centered design process and circuitry concepts to prototype a functional
solution.

Open to both engineering and Trinity College of Arts & Sciences students, the
course provides an interdisciplinary experience with meaningful real-world
applications.

### Previous Student Projects

  * A multifunctional light source, serving as both a headlamp and room light
  * A portable light source for dental examinations
  * Solar-powered lighting on a backpack, for children

## BME 460L: Devices for People with Disabilities

Creating custom technology to aid people in the community

Students receive an overview of assistive technologies, patent issues and
engineering ethics. The service-learning component involves work with people
in the community with physical limitations or disabilities.

Student teams are paired with health care professionals at local hospitals who
supervise product design and development.

## CEE 315: Engineering Sustainable Design and the Global Community

Designing solutions to identified community needs

Working in partnership with a community agency—local, national or
international—students participate in an experimental learning process by
engineering a design solution for an identified community need. Students may
select course section 315-20, which has a structural focus, or section 315-60,
which has an environmental focus.

Students learn technical design principles, sustainable and engineering best
practices, prototype formation, testing and evaluation, and research and
analysis methodologies in a community-based research experience.

  * A pedestrian footbridge for an isolated village in Bolivia
  * A vehicular bridge for a community in Uganda
