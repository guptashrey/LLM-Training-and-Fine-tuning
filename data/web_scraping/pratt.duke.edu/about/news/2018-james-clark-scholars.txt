# 10 of Nation's Brightest College-Bound Students Selected as Inaugural A.
James Clark Scholars at Duke

August 20, 2018

Each scholar receives support to help offset loans, work-study and summer
earnings requirements—allowing freedom to participate in service, activities,
internships, and the creation of their own venture.

Ten outstanding, aspiring engineers have been named as the inaugural class of
A. James Clark Scholars at Duke University, Ravi V. Bellamkonda, Duke’s Vinik
Dean of Engineering, announced.

The Clark Scholars Program is a signature component of Duke Engineering’s
initiative to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset among all its undergraduate
students.

“Entrepreneurship is a powerful way to increase the positive impact of Duke
Engineering innovation on society,” said William Walker, Mattson Family
Director of Entrepreneurship @ Duke Engineering and coordinator of the Clark
Scholars Program at Duke. “We’re building an entrepreneurial community at Duke
Engineering through expert advice, innovative educational experiences, and
direct connections to resources and the wider community on campus.”

> "These students truly embody Duke's 'outrageous ambitions' to take on
> humanity's greatest challenges, and we cannot wait to welcome them to Duke
> and to the Pratt School of Engineering."
>
> **Ravi V. Bellamkonda**  
>  Vinik Dean of Engineering

The A. James Clark Scholars Program, funded through a $15 million gift from
the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation, expands access to Duke’s nationally
recognized engineering education and seeks to create a new generation of
engineering leaders.

Each scholar receives support over four years to help offset loans, work-study
and summer earnings requirements, allowing them freedom to participate in
unpaid service, extracurricular activities, internships, and the creation of
their own venture. The program mirrors the vision and values of construction
pioneer A. James Clark with a focus on engineering, business, leadership and
community service. Clark Scholars at Duke will receive personal mentoring,
enrichment opportunities, and a focused summer program in entrepreneurship and
management.

“Each of our new Clark Scholars has already shown a high level of achievement
and a desire to pursue entrepreneurial approaches with the potential to
transform not only their lives, but the lives of others,” Bellamkonda said.
“These students truly embody Duke’s ‘outrageous ambitions’ to take on
humanity’s greatest challenges, and we cannot wait to welcome them to Duke and
to the Pratt School of Engineering.”

> The group represents 6 states, and a wide range of experiences and
> achievements.

The 10 Clark Scholars, all members of the incoming Class of 2022, were
selected based on financial need, academic accomplishment, engagement in
engineering, and leadership skills.

The class represents students from six states with a wide range of experiences
and achievements. As just one example, Clark Scholar Marcellus Jordan III of
Houston, Texas, said that his passion is robotics—flying drones, competing in
robotics team challenges and donating significant time as a volunteer robotics
instructor.

“I plan to major in mechanical engineering,” Jordan said, “and I want to start
my own company that develops emerging technologies.”

The inaugural class of Clark Scholars at Duke are:

  * **Filip Bartel** of Dumont, New Jersey
  * **William Carlson** of Rustburg, Virginia
  * **Joy Fu** of College Station, Texas
  * **Marcellus Jordan III** of Houston, Texas
  * **Philip Liu** of Austin, Texas
  * **Sophie Rubin** of Roslyn, New York
  * **Hosam Tagel-Din** of Cary, North Carolina
  * **Kayana Tyson** of Woodbridge, Virginia
  * **Christian Welch** of Cartersville, Georgia
  * **Juliet Yznaga** of Austin, Texas

The Clark Scholars Program is the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation’s
signature academic program as part of its commitment to building the pipeline
of future engineers. This inaugural class at Duke will join a Clark Scholars
network that includes students from The George Washington University, Georgia
Tech, Johns Hopkins University, The University of Maryland, University of
Pennsylvania, Stevens Institute of Technology, Vanderbilt University, The
University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech.
