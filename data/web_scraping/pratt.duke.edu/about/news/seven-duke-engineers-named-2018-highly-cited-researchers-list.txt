# Seven Duke Engineers Named to 2018 Highly Cited Researchers List

November 28, 2018

Duke Engineering can claim seven of its faculty members as the most
influential researchers in the world

Duke Engineering can claim seven of its faculty members as the most
influential researchers in the world, according to data collected by Clarivate
Analytics. Clarivate’s “Highly Cited Researchers” list represents the top one
percent of cited researchers, by Essential Science Indicators (ESI) field and
year. For the 2018 Highly Cited Researchers analysis, the papers surveyed were
published and cited during the period of 2006-2016. The 21 broadly defined ESI
fields encompass the sciences and social sciences; this year’s list, for the
first time, also includes researchers who have demonstrated exceptional
performance across fields.

The Duke Engineering faculty recognized in the 2018 Highly Cited Researchers
List, and the fields in which they are recognized, are:

  1. Steven Cummer (ECE) - Physics
  2. David Mitzi (MEMS) – Materials Science
  3. Willie Padilla (ECE) - Physics
  4. Guillermo Sapiro (ECE) - Cross-field
  5. David Smith (ECE) - Physics
  6. Mark Wiesner (CEE) – Environment/Ecology
  7. Benjamin Wiley (Chemistry/MEMS) – Cross-field

Among universities, Duke falls into an overall 10th place tie with the
University of Pennsylvania, each claiming 44 highly cited researchers.
