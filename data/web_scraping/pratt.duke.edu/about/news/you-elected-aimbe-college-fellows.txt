# You Elected to AIMBE College of Fellows

April 10, 2019

Honor represents top 2 percent of medical and biological engineers

Lingchong You has been elected to the College of Fellows at the American
Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE). You, a professor of
biomedical engineering at Duke University, was cited for “pioneering the
engineering of spatiotemporal dynamics in single cells and cell populations
for basic biological understanding and practical applications.”

With You’s election, Duke Biomedical Engineering is home to 25 AIMBE Fellows,
which represent the top 2 percent of accomplished and distinguished medical
and biological engineers responsible for innovation and discovery. Members’
nominations are peer-reviewed by a selection committee and then voted on by
the entire College of Fellows.

You’s research focuses on computational systems biology and synthetic biology,
including mathematical modeling of cellular networks, mechanisms of
information processing by gene networks, and the design, modeling and
construction of robust gene networks for applications in engineering and
medicine.

AIMBE is a nonprofit, honorific society that serves as the authoritative voice
and advocate for the value of medical and biological engineering to society. A
formal induction ceremony was held during the AIMBE Annual Meeting at the
National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC, on March 25, 2019. You was
inducted with 156 colleagues who comprised the AIMBE College of Fellows Class
of 2019.
