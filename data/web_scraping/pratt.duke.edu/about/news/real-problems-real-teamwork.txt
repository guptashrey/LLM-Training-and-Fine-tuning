# Real Problems, Real Teamwork

March 7, 2017

Data+: Duke’s award-winning approach to education for the data age

Duke’s nationally recognized Data+ program brings teams of faculty and
students together each summer to explore data-driven approaches to real-world
problems—including many from clients such as Accenture, Fidelity Charitable
and Duke Health. Impactful projects like the ones below will soon become part
of every Duke Engineering undergraduate’s experience with the debut of an
innovative new Data Science course.

## Solar Counts

With enough solar installations to power 6 million homes, the U.S. energy
infrastructure is rapidly evolving. But while individual states track solar
locations and capacities on a broad scale, there is little information about
exactly where solar energy is emerging on a city or neighborhood level.

With this more precise data, officials could predict where to install new
technology to meet changing demands, social scientists could better understand
how policy affects solar energy adoption and economists could better value the
future of the 8,000 solar companies employing more than 200,000 American
workers.

It’s a gigantic undertaking of great importance, but Duke has just the people
for the job—our undergraduates, who recently began figuring out how to tally
solar capacity from satellite imagery through Duke’s Data+ Program.

A small group of four students, mentored by graduate students and faculty from
Duke Engineering and Duke’s Energy Initiative, spent the summer building a
dataset by meticulously annotating 58 square miles of satellite imagery of
Fresno, California. The team then coded their own proof-of-principle machine
learning algorithm that was able to identify solar panels with over 90 percent
accuracy.

The group then passed the baton to Bass Connections—a program at Duke
supporting interdisciplinary collaborations between faculty and students. Led
by the same faculty, undergraduates expanded the dataset to include three more
cities in California, annotating 20,000 individual solar panels from 1.5
billion pixels of satellite imagery from the U.S. Geological Survey.

The students recently published the massive dataset in an open, online
journal, providing other researchers worldwide with ground-truth data that
could help program algorithms to spot all types of objects from the sky.

## How can we optimize parking on a crowded campus?

Working with Duke Parking and Transportation, a student team examined parking
patterns across the campus and built an interactive “redirection” tool that
could help students and employees figure out the best place to park if their
preferred lot is full. The partners are now discussing ways to operationalize
the tool at Duke.

“Data+ was immensely beneficial for me,” said participant Mitchell Parekh,
ECE’19. “I gained an understanding of what big data really is, along with the
amount of work required to extract usable information from it.”

## Can we build a better mouse map?

BME major Pablo Ortiz and team worked with Duke’s Department of Biostatistics
and Bioinformatics to develop a tool that helps researchers more effectively
utilize LungMAP, an open-access database of images of developing mouse lungs.
They built an image segmentation pipeline to allow biologists and clinical
researchers to quantify changes in lung structure during fetal development,
and improve understanding of normal lung structure and function.

## What’s the best location for Zika vaccination clinics?

Lindsay Hirschhorn ME’19 was part of a team charged with determining optimal
vaccination clinic locations in Durham County for a simulated Zika virus
outbreak. Working with researchers at RTI International to construct models of
disease spread and health impact, the team developed an interactive
visualization tool to show results

“Duke has done a tremendous job in creating a learning environment that
promotes collaboration, drives innovation and creative problem-solving, and
provides enough structure and mentoring to guide students to successful
outcomes,” said RTI’s Thom Miano. “Data+ gives students an opportunity for
valuable experience and employers an avenue for potential recruitment.”

> “Medical applications, robots, infrastructure, new materials—it’s hard to
> think of an area of engineering that’s not going to be driven by data. At
> Duke, we’re training students to navigate in the digital economy not just by
> teaching them how to analyze data, but how to ask the right questions. The
> world needs people who know how to put the chain together.”
