# A Global Approach to Nanoinformatics

March 3, 2017

Since 2008, Duke has led an international consortium of researchers studying
how industrial nanoparticles affect the environment. Other scientists are
doing the same—and the global effort has produced an enormous amount of
valuable data.

But in such a nascent field, experimental procedures are inconsistent, as are
the types of measurements recorded. The resulting data are difficult to merge
into a unified set for deeper analysis and insight.

Duke is leading a global charge to unify the field through the Center for the
Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology Nanoinformatics Knowledge
Commons—CEINT-NIKC for short. With buy-in from the Environmental Protection
Agency and European Union, the center’s goal is to standardize the methods
used and measurements taken in nanoparticle experiments.

In addition to building a custom cyberinfrastructure allowing researchers to
upload their data in a consistent manner, CEINT-NIKC is creating apps that can
sort through the database, pull requested data and run different types of data
analytics­—building a one-stop shopping experience for future researchers.

“Nanoinformatics is trying to draw from the wins we’ve been seeing in
bioinformatics and other Big Data fields, but adapted for application to a
still emerging, relatively immature field,” said Christine Hendren, executive
director of CEINT and co-chair of the National Cancer Informatics Program Nano
Working Group, which has been vital to the effort’s success. “We’re building a
community and providing a path forward to creating depth to our data.”
