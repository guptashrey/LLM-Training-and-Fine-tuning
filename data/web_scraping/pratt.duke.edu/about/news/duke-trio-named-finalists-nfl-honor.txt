# Duke Trio Named Finalists for NFL Honor

January 29, 2020

Former Duke football lettermen Clark Bulleit, Kevin Gehsmann, and Tim Skapek
have been selected one of four finalists for the NFL 1st and Future
innovations competition

_From GoDuke.com_

**DURHAM, N.C. –** Former Duke football lettermen **Clark Bulleit** , **Kevin
Gehsmann** , and **Tim Skapek** have been selected one of four finalists for
the NFL 1st and Future innovations competition.  
  
The trio founded the company Protect3d, which revolutionizes athletic
protection using 3D technology. The original concept started out as an
engineering project for their then teammate and now New York Giants starting
quarterback **Daniel Jones** when he went down with a fractured left clavicle.
They used a 3D scan of Jones to obtain a digital model and created nine
prototypes of the pad, optimizing his range of motion with the Duke athletic
medicine staff. After making slight modifications, the final 3D pad was
printed in structurally sound material.  
  
Jones was back on the field just three weeks after his injury. He wore the
custom pad for the remainder of the season, leading the Blue Devils to an 8-5
record and Independence Bowl victory over Temple.  
  
Since then, Protect3d has made over 100 custom devices for student-athletes at
seven schools.  
  
Bulleit, Gehsmann, and Skapek submitted their product to the fifth annual 1st
and Future competition which is the NFL's annual Super Bowl competition
designed to spur novel advancements in athlete safety and performance. The
threesome will next present their innovation on stage at the Miami Beach
Convention Center on January 31st with the grand prize winner being awarded
$50,000 and two tickets to Super Bowl LIV. The second-place winner will
receive $25,000 and two tickets to the Super Bowl.  
  
During the program, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Michelle Lee, VP of the
Amazon ML Solutions Lab, and former NFL running back Curtis Martin will
participate in a panel discussion on player health and safety innovation. The
panel will be moderated by Dan Hellie of NFL Network, who will also emcee the
competition.  
  
NFL Network will livestream the full competition beginning at 10:30 a.m. The
event will be available at https://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-1st-and-
future-2020-in-miami.

**Innovations to Advance Athlete Health and Safety Competition Finalists**  
 _ **Nextiles** **, Brooklyn, New York**_  
Nextiles builds fabric-based sensors that when sewn into the interior padding
of helmets can locate, triangulate and measure forces impacted on a player's
head in order to quantify the factors that contribute to concussions and
traumatic brain injuries.  
  
_**Physmodo,** **Dallas, Texas**_  
Using its proprietary human tracking skeleton developed specifically for
biomechanics, Physmodo assesses movement patterns through an objective,
automated and 30 second screen.  
  
_**Plantiga** **, Vancouver, British Columbia**_  
Plantiga combines sensor insoles and artificial intelligence that analyze how
people move to improve health, injury rehabilitation and performance.  
  
_**Protect3d** **, Durham, North Carolina**_  
Protect3d leverages 3D scanning and printing technologies to give medical
professionals the ability to create anatomically-precise protective devices,
each optimized for an individual athlete's comfort, mobility and protection.
