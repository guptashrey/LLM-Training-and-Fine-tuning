# Kendall Covington: Engineering Better Medicines

October 7, 2014 | By Kendall Covington

2015 NAE Grand Challenge Scholar Profile

  * **Major:** Biomedical Engineering; Neuroscience Minor
  * **Grand Challenge:** Engineering Better Medicines
  * **GC Advisor:**Professor Nimmi Ramanujam
  * **Project Title:** Addressing Global Women’s Health Concerns

My research centers around the theme of "Engineering Better Medicines,” and
combines my interests in engineering and global health to improve the health
care of women in low-resource settings. Besides taking global health courses,
traveling to Nicaragua to repair medical equipment in hospitals and attending
global conferences, I am working with Dr. Nimmi Ramanujam in the newly formed
Global Women's Health Technology (GWHT) Center on a project that has taken two
forms.

> "Overall, my experience so far with the Grand Challenge Scholars program has
> allowed me to truly experience how engineering can be applied to help solve
> some of the biggest problems in today's world. Never could I have imagined
> that I would be heading up a project to potentially light up an entire
> community in Kenya, or that I would be independently designing medical
> technologies to help improve the clinic care in such an under-resourced
> setting!"

The first focuses on educating girls in engineering. At an all-girl holistic
school in Kenya called WISER, I helped institute an engineering club where we
taught the girls how to build renewable energy flashlights using locally
available materials. This project empowered the girls, reinforced physics
concepts and added creative projects to their otherwise exam-focused
curriculum. The 11 groups built over 25 flashlights to help the students study
when the power is out at night (which occurs frequently)! Next, we plan to
help refine their designs and sell their flashlights to members of the
community, allowing them to light up their homes and earn income to support
further engineering projects.

The second phase and my senior year’s focus involves designing medical
equipment for this area using the Engineering Club girls as on-the-ground
collaborators to fully ensure that we are meeting the needs of the community.
While in Kenya, we talked to local doctors about their unmet needs—especially
relating to HIV—and plan to design a prototype that the Engineering Club
students will help with. This unique opportunity will have the girls inform us
on the availability of materials, construct prototypes on the ground and
gather additional needs information.

Overall, my experience so far with the Grand Challenge Scholars program has
allowed me to truly experience how engineering can be applied to help solve
some of the biggest problems in today's world. Never could I have imagined
that I would be heading up a project to potentially light up an entire
community in Kenya, or that I would be independently designing medical
technologies to help improve the clinic care in such an under-resourced
setting! I think that already this has impacted the direction that my life
will take. I now am moving away from the traditional path of graduating school
to work for a big medical device company—I do not think it would be satisfying
to me—and more toward opportunities like Grand Challenge Scholars that will
allow me to directly improve the lives of others.

outrageously ambitious
