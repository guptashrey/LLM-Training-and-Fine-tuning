# MEMS PhD Grad Selected for Women in Aerospace Symposium

June 19, 2017

PhD Grad Jing Li was one of 16 participants selected to present their research
at the symposium.

Jing Li, a 2016 PhD graduate from Duke University’s Department of Mechanical
Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS), recently participated in the 2017 CU
Boulder-MIT-Stanford Women in Aerospace (WIA) Symposium.

The symposium, which was hosted by the Ann and H.J. Smead Department of
Aerospace Engineering Sciences at University of Colorado at Boulder from May
31 to June 1, offers female doctoral and postdoctoral researchers the
opportunity to present their research, network and learn about a variety of
academic careers they can pursue. After a competitive application process, Li
was one of 16 researchers selected to participate in the annual event.

During the symposium Li had the chance to present her PhD research, which
focuses on predicting a forced response in an embedded compressor rotor. A
forced response occurs when blades in a rotor vibrate due to unsteady
aerodynamic forces, and this topic has been identified by Duke’s GUIde 5
Consortium as one of the greatest aeromechanical challenges for the next
generation of turbomachines.

During Li’s time as w PhD student at Duke she worked under the supervision of
Robert Kielb, associate professor of the practice in MEMS. She is currently a
mechanical engineer at GE Global Research Center in Niskayuna, New York.
