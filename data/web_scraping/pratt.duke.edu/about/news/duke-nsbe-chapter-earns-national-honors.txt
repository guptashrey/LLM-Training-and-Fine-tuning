# Duke NSBE Chapter Earns National Honors

April 7, 2017

Students return from national convention with awards and job offers

The word small might be in the award’s name, but the recognition is big.

The Duke Engineering chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers won
three major awards at its national convention in Kansas City, Missouri,
earlier this month.

The students took home honors as Regional Distinguished Chapter of the Year
and Regional Small Chapter of the Year, and were named National Small Chapter
of the Year.

“I had the pleasure of being at the convention to witness this achievement,”
said Johnna Frierson, a chapter advisor and director of the Pratt Office of
Diversity and Inclusion in Engineering. “To say that I’m excited and proud is
an understatement. What a great year for NSBE and what wonderful recognition
for all of their hard work.”

NSBE is the leading technical organization for African American engineering
students and professionals in the United States, and one of the largest
student-run organizations in the country, with more than 300 collegiate
chapters.

While at the convention, said Pratt chapter President Jessi Daniels, Duke
members had approximately 20 interviews. They came away with eight internship
offers and two full-time job offers.

The success caps off a great year for the NSBE chapter, Daniels said.

“The NSBE chapter represented Duke and Pratt amazingly well,” said Adrienne
Stiff-Roberts, a chapter advisor and associate professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering.
