# Why Virtual Conferences Are Here to Stay

February 16, 2021 | Duke Today

As Duke community members gain experience with virtual conferences, learn why
they feel they’re here to stay

Without requiring people to travel–and thus spend money–to gather at one site,
virtual conferences have long been seen as more affordable, greener
alternatives to in-person events. But they weren’t especially popular without
the face-to-face contact and the networking and camaraderie.

But with COVID-19, many professional conferences have moved to virtual
formats, and both participants and organizers are getting first-hand
experience with the benefits of digital events. Once the pandemic ends,
digital events and conferences will likely endure.

Find out how Duke Engineering and Duke Materials Initiative faculty and staff
had successful poster sessions at the Triangle Hard Matter Workshop via Zoom
in this story in _Duke Today._

outrageously ambitious
