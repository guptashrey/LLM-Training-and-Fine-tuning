# Thirteen Biomedical Engineering Graduate Students Earn National Science
Foundation Fellowships

June 30, 2022 | Michaela Kane

Highly competitive national awards will help new and returning Duke BME
graduate students conduct research on campus

Eleven PhD students and two master’s students in Duke University’s Biomedical
Engineering program received prestigious awards from the National Science
Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program for 2022.

It was an especially banner year for Duke BME students, who received 13 of the
22 NSF Fellowships awarded to graduate students at Duke.

Launched in 1952, the NSF GRFP is the oldest graduate fellowship of its kind.
It funds outstanding graduate students pursuing Ph.D. or research master's
degrees in NSF-supported STEM disciplines. Fellows receive a three-year
stipend, coverage of tuition and fees, and access to professional development
opportunities.

“We are thrilled to celebrate the success of our students,” says Joel Collier,
the Theodore Kennedy Professor of Biomedical Engineering, and the director of
graduate studies in Duke BME. “It’s a reminder that our graduate students are
among the most impressive in the country, and I’m happy to see them recognized
for their innovative research.”
