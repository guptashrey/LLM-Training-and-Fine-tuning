# Duke-led Center Seeks to Examine and Engineer the Microbial Communities of
Indoor Spaces

August 10, 2022 | By Ken Kingery

New $26 million center will work to understand and engineer the microbiomes in
our homes, workspaces and other built environments

A multidisciplinary team of researchers led by Duke University will undertake
an ambitious endeavor to understand and improve the microbial communities that
inhabit the structures in which we live, work and play — what scientists call
the “built environment.”

The Engineering Research Center for Precision Microbiome Engineering, or
PreMiEr, aims to develop diagnostic tools and engineering approaches that
promote building designs for preventing the colonization of harmful bacteria,
fungi or viruses while encouraging beneficial microorganisms.

PreMiEr is funded by a five-year, $26 million grant from the National Science
Foundation (NSF), renewable for a second five-year, $26 million term. The Duke
center is one of four new Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) announced by the
agency today.

> because they want to make the best decisions about what their loved ones are
> exposed to, but that’s a really difficult thing to do because we don’t yet
> know what a healthy microbiome might look like in the places we spend most
> of our time. Our goal is to start to fill those data gaps and lay the
> foundation for researchers to dig into these important questions.”
>
> **claudia gunsch** | director of premier

Joining Duke in the effort are researchers from North Carolina Agricultural
and Technical State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and North Carolina State
University.

“This center touches on the struggles any parent or caregiver undergoes
because they want to make the best decisions about what their loved ones are
exposed to,” said Claudia Gunsch, Professor of Civil and Environmental
Engineering at Duke and the director of PreMiEr.

“But that’s a really difficult thing to do because we don’t yet know what a
healthy microbiome might look like in the places we spend most of our time,”
Gunsch said. “Our goal is to start to fill those data gaps and lay the
foundation for researchers to dig into these important questions.”

Human beings spend more than 90% of their time within built environments — the
homes, offices, cars, hospitals, stores and other manmade enclosures that
underpin modern society. Yet very little is known about the ever-present but
largely invisible populations of microorganisms (built environment
microbiomes) that grow and live in these spaces.

That’s a big blind spot, given that there are roughly just as many bacterial
cells as there are human cells within a human body, and there are bound to be
interactions between those microbes and those in the built environment.
Diseases such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, irritable bowel disease and many
others have already been linked to changes within the human microbiome.
Understanding which microbes are thriving in the spaces we spend most of our
time and how they affect us and our own microbiomes is the first step toward
teasing out their potential health effects, both positive and negative.

> “Duke is thrilled to lead this effort and expand upon our deep
> collaborations with academic, industry, and community partners,
> interdisciplinary research culture, innovative spirit, and commitment to
> broadening participation in STEM.”

“On the heels of a global pandemic costing over five million lives globally,
PreMiEr outlines a timely and audacious vision for microbiome engineering in
the built environment that could help us avoid such calamities while leading
to tremendous impact on our quality of life,” said Jerome Lynch, Vinik Dean of
Duke’s Pratt School of Engineering.

“We want to be able to go into hospital rooms or other closed environments and
devise treatment strategies for unwanted microbes,” Gunsch added. “That’s
something that is achievable in the short term. For the long term, we want to
develop the tools, procedures and knowledge base needed to identify and define
what a healthy microbiome looks like and devise approaches for promoting those
healthy microbiomes across a wide range of built environments.”

PreMiEr will focus its efforts through an inclusive and collaborative lens to
ensure that any of the questions asked or solutions pursued incorporate a wide
range of cultural and societal viewpoints. This is reflected in the structure
of the research center, which includes a core area for investigating the
societal and ethical implications of microbiome engineering to innovate
responsibly.

Of the more than 40 researchers, almost half are women and nearly 20% belong
to historically marginalized groups in STEM. Through its partnership with NC
A&T, the nation’s largest historically black college and university, and other
institutions sharing the goal of broadening participation in STEM, the center
will contribute to the development of a diverse workforce capable of tackling
these critical challenges into the future.

“Duke is thrilled to lead this effort and expand upon our deep collaborations
with academic, industry, and community partners, interdisciplinary research
culture, innovative spirit, and commitment to broadening participation in
STEM,” said Duke President Vincent Price.

> “For decades, NSF Engineering Research Centers have transformed technologies
> and fostered innovations in the United States through bold research,
> collaborative partnerships, and a deep commitment to inclusion and
> broadening participation. The new NSF centers will continue the legacy of
> impacts that improve lives across the Nation.”

Joining Gunsch on the PreMiEr leadership team are four distinguished faculty
from neighboring North Carolina institutions:

  * Jill Stewart, the Philip C. Singer Distinguished Professor of
    Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the UNC-Chapel Hill Gillings
    School of Global Public Health
  * Joseph Graves Jr, professor of biological sciences at NC A&T
  * Jennifer Kuzma, the Goodnight-NCGSK Foundation Distinguished Professor in
    the School of Public and International Affairs and co-director of the
    Genetic Engineering and Society Center at NC State
  * Anthony Fodor, professor of bioinformatics at UNC Charlotte.

The NSF ERC program supports convergent research that will lead to strong
societal impact. Each ERC has interacting foundational components that go
beyond the research project, including engineering workforce development at
all participant stages, fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion where
all participants gain mutual benefit, and creating value within an innovation
ecosystem that will outlast the lifetime of the ERC. The program was created
in 1984 to bring technology-based industry and universities together in an
effort to strengthen the competitive position of American industry in the
global marketplace.

“For decades, NSF Engineering Research Centers have transformed technologies
and fostered innovations in the United States through bold research,
collaborative partnerships, and a deep commitment to inclusion and broadening
participation," said Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of NSF. “The new NSF
centers will continue the legacy of impacts that improve lives across the
Nation.”
