# Four Duke Engineers Recognized as Most Cited

November 18, 2020

Four Duke Engineers are included in the most highly-cited list this year.
Their scholarly publications are viewed as important and influential by their
peers.

Four Duke Engineers are once again prominently featured on the annual list of
"Most Highly Cited Researchers." They include Charles Gersbach (BME), David
Mitzi (MEMS), David Smith (ECE) and Mark Wiesner (CEE). All four researchers
were also included in the list from 2019.

The four faculty members join 33 of their Duke faculty peers in being named to
the list this year, based on the number of highly cited papers they produced
over an 11-year period from January 2009 to December 2019. Citation rate, as
tracked by Clarivate's Web of Science, is an approximate measure of a study's
influence and importance.

This year, 6,127 researchers from 60 countries are being recognized by the
listing. The United States still dominates, with 41 percent of the names on
the list, but China continues to grow its influence, with 12 percent of the
names.

The data are taken from 21 broad research fields. The fields are defined by
sets of journals and, in the case of multidisciplinary journals such as
_Nature_ and _Science_ , by a paper-by-paper assignment to a field based on an
analysis of the cited references in the papers. ISI-Web of Science also
weighted the occurrence of self-citation in their analyses, though this
practice varies by discipline.
