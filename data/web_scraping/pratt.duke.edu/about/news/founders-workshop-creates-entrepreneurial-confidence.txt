# Founder's Workshop Creates Entrepreneurial Confidence

March 11, 2019

Part of Duke Engineering's signature undergraduate experience, the innovative
course is taught by Silicon Valley exec and entrepreneur Steve McClelland E'95

The Duke Engineering Founder's Workshop was created through a bit of the same
bold entrepreneurial process that led instructor Steve McClelland to found two
successful software start-ups.

"I asked what if I created a class where students could bring their own
ideas," said McClelland, a 1995 Duke Engineering graduate, former executive
for Yahoo! and Twitter, and now executive-in-residence in the Entrepreneurship
@ Duke Engineering office. "And then build a structure around finding out if
those ideas are any good."

The result is the Founder's Workshop, a special-topics course cross-listed in
the Pratt School of Engineering and the Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship
Initiative. The course is open to all undergraduates, but students apply to
McClelland first to discuss their ideas for potentially marketable solutions
to problems.

During McClelland's course, students gather into teams. Some students work on
ideas they brought into the class, others join those efforts.

Meeting twice a week, the class usually spends one session hearing from expert
guest speakers, who share their experiences investigating, developing,
activating and growing start-ups. Other course meetings include regular update
presentations from each student team.

Anshu Dwibhasi, a senior studying electrical and computer engineering as well
as computer science, led a team working on an intriguing idea—a smartphone app
that would both rate fraternity and student parties while also making them
safer. Transparency is the key, he said during one presentation. The team had
decided that students, party hosts and university administrators would all
have access to the app.

"It has been an interesting exercise and we realize that there is a lot to do
to found a company," Dwibhasi said after his presentation. "At the end of this
course, the goal is to have the tools required to start a successful company."

Practice of these new skills is a big part of building each student's
entrepreneurial confidence, McClelland said. The course is both about building
that confidence and demystifying the founder's journey.

"At first this stuff is new and it's awkward," he said. "After you do it a few
times, you get faster and you build confidence. I think this course is unique
in the engineering curriculum."
