# Duke Students — Speed Demons on One Wheel

June 23, 2020

A team of ambitious mechanical engineering students from Duke University set
out to build the EV360: the world’s fastest monowheel.

_From Duke Today_

A team of ambitious mechanical engineering students from Duke University set
out to build the EV360: the world’s fastest monowheel. Over the course of a
year, they built it almost entirely at Duke University’s Innovation Co-Lab,
the makerspace on campus, giving them the tools to create anything from metal
to 3D printed parts.

The monowheel is 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide and can carry a suited-up driver
over 45 mph. The team has been given the green light to attempt the world
record by Guinness World Records for the fastest electric 1-wheeled monowheel
(over 45 mph) and they may even attempt the fastest overall monowheel (over 61
mph).

The team has evolved over time, with many student and faculty supporters and
advisors, but the core team consists of: Anuj Thakkar, Team Lead & Engineer
Carlo Lindner, Engineer Ahmed Ahmed-Fouad, Engineer Francisco Romano, Lead
Cinematographer Jolán von Plutzner, Engineer.
