# Calculating the Cost of Power

November 17, 2020

A new report examines the costs and benefits of replacing nuclear energy with
hydropower, at one site in New York City

When the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) closes in 2021, New York City will
need to replace 15 TW·h per year of nuclear power. A new analysis from Ryan
Calder (formerly a postdoctoral student in the Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineeringpost and now a faculty member at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University), Duke CEE professor Mark Borsuk, and Duke CEE
PhD student Celine Robinson quantifies the economic and environmental costs
and benefits of one potential replacement power source—increased hydropower
imports from Québec.

The potential role of increased imports of hydropower from Canada to the New
York City area has been controversial because of large upfront capital costs
and uncertain benefits, relative to alternatives such as increased build-out
of downstate New York offshore wind and solar. The new study, published by the
Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions, identifies conceivable
scenarios for responding to the closure of IPEC and uses publicly available
data to quantify the plausible ranges of direct and indirect economic and
environmental costs and benefits of each scenario over the period 2021–2050.
