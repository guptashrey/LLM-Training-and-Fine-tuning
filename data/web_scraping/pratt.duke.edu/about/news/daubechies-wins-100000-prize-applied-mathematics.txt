# Daubechies Wins $100,000 Prize in Applied Mathematics

June 15, 2018

Professor Ingrid Daubechies is the first female recipient of the William
Benter Prize in Applied Mathematics

_FromDuke Today_

Duke University professor Ingrid Daubechies  is the first female recipient of
the William Benter Prize in Applied Mathematics.

Given every two years, this prestigious award recognizes outstanding
mathematical contributions that have had a direct and fundamental impact on
scientific, business, finance and engineering applications. Daubechies is a
professor in the departments of Mathematics and Electrical and Computer
Engineering whose work has ranged from wavelets and the compression of images
to applied mathematical algorithms for recognizing art forgeries. Daubechies
has worked to build global mathematics networks and provide better training
for scientists and engineers in developing countries, and to encourage greater
interest in mathematics among women.

Daubechies received the award in person at the 2018 International Conference
on Applied Mathematics, held June 4-8 at City University of Hong Kong. After
the prize presentation ceremony she gave a plenary lecture titled
“Biologically relevant distances between morphological surfaces representing
teeth and bones.”
