# Chakrabarty Receives Humboldt Research Award

November 20, 2013

Granted by the Humboldt Foundation to outstanding researchers whose
fundamental discoveries have had significant impact

Krishnendu Chakrabarty, a professor in Duke's Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering, has been elected to receive the Humboldt Research Award.

This prestigious award is granted by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to
"outstanding researchers whose fundamental discoveries, new theories, or
insights have had a significant impact on their own discipline and who are
expected to continue producing cutting-edge achievements in the future."

The award is given to fewer than 100 researchers each year across all
disciplines. Alexander von Humboldt was a mid-19th century nature researcher
and explorer of South America.

"I am very honored to receive this lifetime achievement award, and I look
forward to many more years of productive research," Chakrabarty said. "This
award is a strong encouragement to continue the tradition of research
excellence that has been established in my group."

Humboldt award recipients are each awarded a prize of 60,000 euros (nearly
$80,000 at current exchange rates) and extended an invitation to pursue
research of their choice with colleagues in Germany. Chakrabarty will focus
his research on resilient computing systems, with emphasis on design for test
and data-driven adaptation. He emphasized that his success is a team effort.

"I would like to thank my graduate students (who teach me as much as I teach
them) and my collaborators from all over the world," he said.

Chakrabarty will be formally recognized at the annual meeting of the Humboldt
Foundation in March 2014, and at a special reception with the president of
Germany in Berlin in June 2014.
