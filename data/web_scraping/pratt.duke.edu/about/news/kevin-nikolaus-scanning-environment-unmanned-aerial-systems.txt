# Kevin Nikolaus: Scanning the Environment with Unmanned Aerial Systems

October 8, 2014 | By Kevin Nikolaus

##### NAE Grand Challenge Scholar Profile

  * **Major:** Mechanical Engineering; Energy and the Environment, German
  * **Grand Challenge:** Engineering the Tools for Scientific Discovery
  * **GC Advisor:** Dr. Michail Zavlanos
  * **Project Title:** Mobile Robotics in Disaster Response and Environmental
    Management

My Grand Challenge Scholar research centers on the challenge of engineering
the tools of scientific discovery. Although it is one of the less mentioned of
the fourteen NAE grand challenges, I believe that it holds a crucial role in
designing a better future.

I focus my work on unmanned aerial system (UAS) integration with the
environmental and geophysical sciences—work that builds on my previous efforts
in the Robotics and Manufacturing Automation laboratory at Duke as well as my
cross-institutional collaboration with the Alaskan Center for Unmanned Aerial
System Integration (ACUASI) and the Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks,
Alaska. I am pursuing this line of research because accurate data about
dangerous and hard-to-reach environments is important to understand our planet
and its changes. To stress this point, I am looking at writing my grand
challenge senior thesis on UAS collision avoidance in polar winter conditions.

This program has certainly changed my perspective on engineering in a way that
I can’t help but describe as career-altering. This is because, even though I
have long been drawn toward technical work, my passion for environmentalism
demands that I act to help solve the environmental challenges that loom ahead.
I know this opportunity will be the highlight of my experience at Duke and
affect my trajectory long after I graduate next spring. I am already looking
into opportunities with various start-ups as well as the Department of
Interior and US Geological Survey to continue working the challenging task of
robotic-assisted environmental research.

outrageously ambitious
