# Artists Draw Inspiration from Constructal Law

May 12, 2016

The law of physics, design and evolution states that any flowing system
allowed to change freely over time will evolve toward an easier flowing
architecture

Two international artists have found inspiration in the Constructal Law—the
law of physics of design and evolution, penned by Duke's Adrian Bejan, stating
that any flowing system allowed to change freely over time will evolve toward
an easier flowing architecture. This law accounts for the similarity in shape
and design in rivers, roads and vascular systems, where a few large channels
carry massive flows to numerous smaller branches for evacuation.

One gallery exhibition is by Juana Gomez, which opened from April 6-24 in the
gallery Isabel Croxatto located in Santiago, Chile. In this series, live
architectures of various organs of our bodies are embroidered on printed
fabrics with photos. In the simultaneous exhibit, Maria Santos Blanco
presented "Ley Constructal" from April 1-15 in the House of Youth Las Rozas in
Madrid, Spain. Below is a sampling of their beautiful and innovative works.

"Inspiration flows both ways, from art to science, and then from science to
art." said Bejan. "In both, the human experience is the same—an unexpected,
sudden pleasure from new images in the body of the mind.

"Art and science are one," he continued. "Both speak in terms of images in the
mind. Both are useful because they empower us for the future. Both are
'beautiful' because they make us better. Juana Gomez's and Maria Santos's
stunning art teaches not only the beauty, the unexpected and the power, but
also the oneness of art and science."
