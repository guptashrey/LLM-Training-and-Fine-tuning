# Chilkoti Elected to IAMBE College of Fellows

May 26, 2020

Distinction recognizes outstanding contributions to the profession of medical
and biological engineering

Ashutosh Chilkoti, the Alan L. Kaganov Distinguished Professor of Biomedical
Engineering, has been elected to the 2020 Class of Fellows of the
International Academy of Medical and Biological Engineering (IAMBE).

IAMBE is made up of fellows who are recognized for their outstanding
contributions to the profession of medical and biological engineering at an
international level. Nominated and elected by all active fellows of the
academy, the 2020 class features 28 distinguished new members.

Chilkoti is the chair of Duke BME, where his research in biomolecular
engineering and bio interface science focuses on the development of new
molecular tools and technologies. Using techniques spanning molecular biology,
protein engineering, polymer chemistry and surface science, Chilkoti and his
lab have pioneered numerous tools and materials including low-cost diagnostic
devices, biosensors and biomaterials that promote drug delivery.

Due to challenges caused by the global coronavirus pandemic, IAMBE Fellows
will be inducted during a virtual session, in conjunction with the Carnegie
Mellon Forum on Biomedical Engineering, to be held on September 18, 2020.
