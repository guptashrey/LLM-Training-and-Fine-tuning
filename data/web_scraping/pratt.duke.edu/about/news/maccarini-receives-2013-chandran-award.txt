# Maccarini Receives 2013 Chandran Award

November 8, 2013

Paolo Maccarini, Ph.D., received the 2013 Chandran Discretionary Research
Award for his proposal entitled, "A Novel MR-Based Noninvasive Method to
Safely Modulate the Opening of Blood-Brain-Barrier to Enhance Drug Delivery
into Brain Tumors and Target Neurological Diseases."

Paolo Maccarini, Ph.D., received the 2013 Chandran Discretionary Research
Award for his proposal entitled, "A Novel MR-Based Noninvasive Method to
Safely Modulate the Opening of Blood-Brain-Barrier to Enhance Drug Delivery
into Brain Tumors and Target Neurological Diseases." Maccarini is an Assistant
Research Professor in the Duke Department of Biomedical Engineering.

The proposed multidisciplinary collaboration aims to demonstrate a novel
noninvasive method to temporarily open the blood-brain-barrier in a safe and
reversible manner. The method responds to an unmet clinical need of a low cost
and safe solution to enhance the delivery of therapeutic or imaging agents
into brain, including targeting of tumors or neurodegenerative diseases such
as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's.

The proposed non-invasive magnetic resonance technique to temporarily and
reversibly open the this barrier could have far-reaching impact.

## About the Award

Beverly A. and Clarence J. Chandran established this award to fund Duke
University research related to early detection of brain tumors. The major
goals of this initiative are to design better methods of tumor detection,
tumor characterization, and measurement of effects of tumor therapy in the
brain or spinal cord.
