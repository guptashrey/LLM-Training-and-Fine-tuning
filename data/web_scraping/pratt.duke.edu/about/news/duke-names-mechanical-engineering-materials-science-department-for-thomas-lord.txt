# Duke Names Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science Department for
Benefactor Thomas Lord

October 6, 2020

MEMS department and chair position named to recognize long-term contributions
of former LORD Corporation chair Thomas Lord and president Donald Alstadt to
the Pratt School of Engineering

Duke University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
will become the first department at the university to be named in honor of a
benefactor, following approval by the Board of Trustees.

The Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science
recognizes the transformative contributions of the late Thomas Lord, chairman
and CEO of LORD Corporation, who established the Lord Foundation of North
Carolina (LFNC) with $40 million in stock holdings in 1984 to support
research, teaching and programming in engineering and related programs at Duke
University.

Over 35 years, LFNC generated more than $47 million for a wide variety of
programs and activities in the Pratt School of Engineering.

> “Tom Lord’s original investment has enabled the remarkable evolution of
> engineering at Duke over the decades, and his support continues to provide
> an invaluable source of flexible support to fuel our education and research
> missions. We are delighted to create our first named department at Duke as a
> permanent way to honor his vision and impact.”
>
> **Vincent Price** |president of Duke University

In 2019, following the sale of LORD Corporation to Parker-Hannifin, Duke and
three other research institutions selected as beneficiaries by Thomas Lord
received a total distribution of over $1 billion through their respective
foundations.

The $261 million allocation to Duke was designated for the university’s
endowment to provide a permanent source of long-term support for science and
technology education and research at the Pratt School of Engineering, as well
as financial aid for undergraduate students across Duke. It was the largest
single outside contribution to the fund since the founding of the university
in 1924.

“Tom Lord’s original investment has enabled the remarkable evolution of
engineering at Duke over the decades, and his support continues to provide an
invaluable source of flexible support to fuel our education and research
missions,” said Vincent Price, president of Duke University. “We are delighted
to create our first named department at Duke as a permanent way to honor his
vision and impact.”

The Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS) was
selected for naming in part to recognize the LORD Corporation’s roots in
mechanical engineering innovation, as well as the strong ties between the
company and two former Duke Engineering deans, George Pearsall and Earl Dowell
(currently the William Holland Hall Distinguished Professor in MEMS).

## Duke MEMS Chair Named for Alstadt

In addition, the MEMS department chair position will be named in honor of
Donald M. Alstadt, former president of LORD Corporation and 24-year member of
the Pratt School’s Board of Visitors, who originally introduced Thomas Lord to
Duke.

“MEMS at Duke is a thriving department with strong faculty leading advances in
areas such as materials discovery, biomedical devices and materials, energy
and autonomous systems, as well as a track record of educating students who go
on to become leaders and innovators,” said Ravi Bellamkonda, the Vinik Dean of
Engineering. “While the LORD funds benefit research and education across the
entire Pratt School, naming the MEMS department is a wonderful way to pay
tribute to Tom Lord’s spirit of innovation, and the named chair to recognize
Donald Alstadt’s pivotal role in the partnership that continues to advance
Duke Engineering and the university as a whole.”

The Thomas Lord Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science
includes more than 40 faculty—including three members of the National Academy
of Engineering—along with 160 doctoral and master’s students and 320
undergraduate majors.

It has more than 3,500 active alumni across the U.S. and worldwide. With
external research funding nearly doubling over the past seven years to
approximately $10 million in new awards annually, Duke MEMS currently ranks
#10 among U.S. mechanical engineering departments in research productivity per
faculty member, according to Academic Analytics.

Cate Brinson, an internationally known soft-matter expert, will be the first
Donald M. Alstadt Chair; she will also continue to hold the Sharon C. and
Harold L. Yoh, III Professorship in Mechanical Engineering and Materials
Science.

Under her leadership, department priorities include building on Duke MEMS’s
strengths in interdisciplinary research; transforming teaching labs to support
the faculty’s vision for personalized, hands-on engineering design education;
and attracting a diverse group of talented students to the fields of
mechanical engineering and materials science through paid undergraduate
research experiences and graduate fellowships.

“Duke MEMS is an exciting place, at the true intersection of mechanical and
materials engineering. Our faculty are making discoveries and developing
innovations with applications ranging from aerospace to human health, and our
amazing students are passionate about using mechanical and materials
engineering principles to make a difference in the world,” said Brinson. “I am
delighted that we will now be known as the ‘Thomas Lord Department of
Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science’ in recognition of a fellow
engineer with vision and a commitment to investing in the future. Thanks to
Tom Lord and Don Alstadt, we are poised to build on the great potential of
engineering at Duke and beyond.”

Thomas Lord and Donald Alstadt were true visionaries who pioneered significant
advances in mechanical engineering, materials science and chemistry, and
believed that innovation combined with corporate social responsibility could
yield vast benefits for society, noted lawyer Mickey Pohl, who since the early
1980s was part of the corporate governance structure of LORD Corporation and
Jura Corporation (created by Lord’s estate plan as a holding company for stock
in LORD Corporation). Their belief that renowned education and research
institutions would be critical drivers of such advances led to the creation of
Lord’s estate plan to benefit a few selected institutions they had identified
as exemplary leaders, including Duke, he added.

“Tom Lord and Don Alstadt would be absolutely delighted to see this come to
fruition,” said Pohl. “They loved what they had seen being done at Duke and I
am certain that they would be most pleased with what Duke has done, and will
continue to do, with the resources generated through LORD Corporation and the
Lord Foundation. Mr. Lord’s vision and generosity, embodied in his unique
estate plan, has become a great story in philanthropy.”
