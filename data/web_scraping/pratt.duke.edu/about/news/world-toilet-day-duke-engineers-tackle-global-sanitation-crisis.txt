# World Toilet Day: Duke Engineers Tackle the Global Sanitation Crisis

November 16, 2017

Duke engineers are leading two projects backed by the Gates Foundation to
bring sanitation to the developing world

On Sunday, November 19, the world will turn its attention to the lowly—yet
incredibly important—toilet bowl. World Toilet Day was created in 2013 by the
United Nations General Assembly to inspire action to tackle the global
sanitation crisis. Today, 4.5 billion people live without a household toilet
that safely disposes of their waste.

One of the organizations leading the way toward solutions is the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, which launched the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge in
2011. Grants were awarded to sixteen researchers around the world who are
using innovative approaches—based on fundamental engineering processes—for the
safe and sustainable management of human waste.

Duke University researchers are leading two of these important projects, and
have been tasked with establishing a new Sanitation Technology Cluster, which
will go beyond toilet designs to fill various gaps in sanitation solutions.
Below, learn more about how Marc Deshusses, professor of civil and
environmental engineering; Jeff Glass, professor of electrical and computer
engineering; and Brian Stoner, research professor of electrical and computer
engineering, are working to bring sanitation to areas in need.
