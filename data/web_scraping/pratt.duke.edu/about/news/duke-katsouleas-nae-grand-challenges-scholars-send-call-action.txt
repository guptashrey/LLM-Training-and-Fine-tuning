# Duke Katsouleas NAE Grand Challenges Scholars Send a Call to Action

April 13, 2020

Brainstorm, accelerate and deploy is the strategy

Andrew Mang graduated from Duke in 2012 with a degree in mechanical
engineering, and in recent years started his own water engineering services
firm in Rwanda. Rachael Lau is studying civil and environmental engineering
and will graduate this spring, after working on numerous international
development projects in Madagascar, Tibet and elsewhere. Both Mang and Lau are
Katsouleas National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges Scholars at
Duke and are calling their engineering colleagues to action in the fight
against SARS-CoV-2.

Their Call to Action asks engineers to brainstorm ideas and volunteer
completed technologies or mentoring capabilities that can be accelerated and
deployed where they are most needed. They are seeking a wide range of
experience and expertise, as the hugely disruptive effects of COVID-19 extend
far beyond health and medicine, to sustainability and recovery, security and
quality of life—all themes that the NAE Grand Challenges Scholars Program’s
founding universities, including Duke, originally identified as areas that
must be improved in order to improve life on our planet.

The NAE’s Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) alumni and NAE members are
participating as both contributors and mentors to GCSP students or other
engineers as ideas develop, and technical specialists and social entrepreneurs
will also take part in proposal development, according to the program’s
website.
