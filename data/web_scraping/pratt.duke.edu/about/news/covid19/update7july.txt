# Building Access Updates

_July 7, 2020_

Dear Pratt faculty and staff,

As we enter Phase 3 of Duke’s Return to Campus effort, more of us will return
to prepare for the fall semester. I am writing with some updates on procedures
and important reminders about coming to campus.

  * **While more people will be on campus over the next month, only those who
    need to be on campus for lab-based research, support of research, or
    preparation for courses for fall should return.** If you can work
    remotely, you should continue to do so; those who need to come to campus
    should limit their time here.

  * **All faculty, staff and graduate students returning to campus on a
    regular basis (even once a week)** **must register before returning.**
    Faculty can register themselves, their research staff or graduate students
    with this link. Administrative staff will be registered by their
    department or unit business manager when they are approved to return to
    the workplace. The business managers will also provide information on how
    to obtain reusable masks.

  * **Anyone reporting to work on-site must complete the** **symptom
    monitoring survey** **through the REDCap system each day** before coming
    to campus. Watch this short video tutorial to understand how to do so.

  * **Faculty and staff who need one-time access to campus** (for example, to
    retrieve an item) no longer need to contact anyone in advance. However,
    you must complete the daily symptom monitoring survey before coming to
    campus.

  * **All Pratt facilities remain locked** and continue to require card swipes
    to access.

  * **Thanks to excellent compliance from those currently working on-site** in
    completing the daily screenings, we will no longer require check-outs.
    However, we will continue to monitor the health screening reports weekly
    to ensure continued compliance.

  * **While on campus, everyone must follow** **Duke’s health and safety
    policies** **, including physical distancing requirements, wearing masks
    and regular handwashing.** Face masks or face coverings must be worn by
    all staff working on campus when in the presence of others and in public
    settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain
    (e.g., common workspaces, meeting rooms, classrooms, etc.) If you are in a
    personal office alone with the door closed, you may remove your mask.

  * **No in-person meetings may be held on campus** ; all meetings should take
    place virtually using Zoom, Webex or other software.

Thank you again for your attention to these measures to help keep everyone
safe. You can find more details and FAQs through the Duke United website and
the Duke Guide to Returning to the Workplace.

If you have additional questions, please contact your business manager; Pratt
Facilities, Infrastructure and Safety Director Mitchell Vann at
mitchell.vann@duke.edu; or me at george.truskey@duke.edu.

Sr. Associate Dean
