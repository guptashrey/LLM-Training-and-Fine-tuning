# Updates: Facility Access, PPE Donations, COVID-19 Research, and Deliveries

_March 25, 2020_

Dear Pratt faculty,

I am writing with a few reminders and updates related to Pratt operations in
light of the recent stay-at-home order issued by the Durham mayor’s office.
Please share with your lab staff and students as needed.

**Access to Pratt Facilities**

  * As noted in the Duke-wide memo sent by Kyle Cavanaugh today, **“**
    **Individuals who are maintaining critical research laboratory functions
    may continue to do so provided they observe safety guidelines. However,
    access to offices and classrooms for the purposes of teaching online
    classes is no longer permitted.”**

  * The expectation continues to be that all Pratt personnel are working
    remotely, with the exception of those individuals who have been approved
    by the Senior Associate Dean for Research to continue **limited** ,
    critical work in research labs. As noted in our March 20 memo, any
    essential work performed on campus **must** be done voluntarily--no one
    can be forced to carry out this work if they are concerned about being
    placed at risk of disease.

  * Pratt faculty who had planned to use offices or classrooms for online
    teaching--such as to record lessons using Panopto--may no longer do so.
    Please check keepteaching.duke.edu for resources for teaching from home.
    If you are concerned about your home internet connectivity or bandwidth,
    please complete the Duke OIT speed test following these instructions and
    make note of the data. You can then contact help@pratt.duke.edu for
    assistance.

**Donations of Personal Protective Equipment**

Duke has received many offers of PPE for colleagues in the Health System, and
has established a central drop-off for easy donation. Click here for more
information.

**Deliveries**

New procedures for package delivery were issued and posted to the
pratt.duke.edu/covid19 webpage on March 24.

**Working with SARS-CoV-2**

Investigators wishing to initiate any studies with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 should
register their intent by completing the survey here, or through MyResearchHome
by clicking “Planning Coronavirus Research? Notify Us” in the COVID-19 Quick
Links.

Thank you for your continued flexibility and patience in adapting to the
challenges presented by COVID-19. If you have questions or need assistance,
please email **pratt-research@duke.edu** **.**

_George A. Truskey_  
 _Senior Associate Dean for Research_
