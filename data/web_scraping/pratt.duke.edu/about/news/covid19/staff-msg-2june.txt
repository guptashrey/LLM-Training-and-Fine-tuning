# Accessing Engineering Buildings

_June 2, 2020_ __

**Duke Engineering Buildings Are Only Open to Lab-Based Research  
If One-Time Access is Needed, Contact You Supervisor First**

Dear Pratt staff,

There has been an increase in the number of one-time requests by staff to
access engineering buildings on the Duke Campus. In general, these buildings
(Fitzpatrick, Hudson and Teer, and portions of North and Gross) are only open
to those doing lab-based research.

However, sometimes you may need to retrieve an item. If that is the case, then
first please notify your supervisor, who will forward the information to
Mitchell Vann at Pratt Facilities. Then, you will need to complete the Duke
Employee Occupational Health and Welfare (EOHW) survey information below and
the daily health screen.

Importantly—Please know that for the people entering these buildings, Duke has
created specific health and safety guidelines, including social distancing
(maintain 6-foot distance from others) and wearing a mask at all times while
in the buildings. More information about the health and safety guidelines.

**EOHW Survey Links:**

  * Register for daily symptom screening and departure logs
  * Instructions for daily symptom screening and departure logs

Thanks,

**George A. Truskey, PhD**  
Senior Associate Dean  
R. Eugene and Susie E. Goodson Professor of Biomedical Engineering
