# Important Reminders for the Pratt Community

Dear Pratt community,

With a wintry start to the new semester, please remember to follow these
important COVID safety precautions on campus, **especially when you are
inside.  
**

  * **You are expected to wear a mask at all times when you are in public
    spaces, including all Pratt facilities.** Wearing a mask or face covering
    is a primary condition of the Duke Compact, and one of the most important
    steps you can take to protect yourself and others around you. See the
    latest masking guidance from Duke.

  * **Avoid eating or drinking inside Pratt facilities.** To limit potential
    spread of COVID-19, we ask that you return to your dorm room/apartment or
    go outside if you need to unmask to eat or drink. We understand there may
    be times this is not possible due to weather (rain) or scheduling (not
    enough time between classes). In these cases--which should be the
    exception and not the rule--make sure you are following Duke’s safety
    protocols by removing your mask only if you are a) alone in a confined
    room, such as a personal office or b) actively eating or drinking, _while
    at least 6 feet away from others and facing away from them_ (put your mask
    back on as soon as you finish).

  * **Please do not move furniture** ; many rooms have purposefully placed or
    assigned seating to facilitate social distancing.

  * **Do not exceed maximum occupancy** for a given room. See the COVID-
    specific occupancy guidelines posted on or near the door. Extra chairs
    have been removed from many rooms to reflect maximum occupancy; again, do
    not move furniture from one room to another.

  * **Socially-distanced study spaces** have been established in a few Pratt
    locations including the Fitzpatrick Center atrium, lobby outside Schiciano
    auditorium and Wilkinson Building Learning Commons, for students to use
    when waiting between classes. All safety guidelines must be followed, and
    students are encouraged to leave the buildings when they have finished
    classes for the day.

  * **In-person gatherings** other than scheduled classes and approved student
    activities are limited to 10 persons, with at least 6 feet between them.
    All attendees must remain masked, and neither food nor beverages consumed.

  * **Conference rooms are not available within the Pratt School at this
    time.** Any **** allowed meetings should take place within designated
    large-capacity classrooms, one of which will be made available in each
    building (Hudson, Teer, Fitzpatrick and Wilkinson). To reserve a space,
    email prattdeansoffice@duke.edu. **  
**

  * **Virtual meetings are still encouraged whenever feasible, and all in-
    person meetings require an alternative attendance option.** The host must
    provide all attendees a Zoom link to be able to join the meeting
    virtually, and no one should be expected to attend in person if they are
    not comfortable doing so.

  * **No in-person public events are currently permitted on the Duke campus.**
    This includes performances, concerts, lectures, reunions, alumni and
    development programs, conferences, symposia, tours, board meetings and any
    other event to which individuals who are not Duke students, faculty or
    staff would be invited or expected to attend.

Please visit returnto.duke.edu for more information, and contact Pratt
Facilities if you have questions or concerns:

  * Mitchell Vann, Director of Facilities at Mitchell.vann@duke.edu or
    919-660-5317
  * Kevin Wood, Assistant Director of Facilities at kevin.wood@duke.edu or
    919-667-4611
  * Cole Klovski, Duke@Chesterfield Building Services Coordinator at
    cole.klovski@duke.edu or 919-452-0053

Thank you for doing your part to keep Duke safe and healthy.

**Claudia Gunsch**  
Associate Dean for Research & Infrastructure

**Mitchell Vann**  
Director of Facilities
