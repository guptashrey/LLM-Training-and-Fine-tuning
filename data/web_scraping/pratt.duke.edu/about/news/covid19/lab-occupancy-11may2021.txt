# Update: Lab Occupancy Guidelines

_May 11, 2021_

Dear Pratt faculty,

Please know that the Pratt School of Engineering, in compliance with Duke
University guidance, has updated one of the General Principles that govern
health and safety measures in research laboratories.

Effective immediately in Pratt research laboratories, the guidance requiring
each person present in a lab to maintain 250 square feet around them is no
longer in effect.

However, in all Pratt labs, everyone must continue to:

  * Wear effective face coverings over nose and mouth at all times
  * Maintain minimum 6 feet (approx. 2 meters) separation from others while in
    the lab

Since every lab is different, please pay close attention to your lab's
configuration when complying with the 6-foot separation rule.

Importantly, it is possible that this updated guidance could change a lab's
maximum occupancy, as stated in its current research plan. If a change is
required to your lab plan, please submit a new and updated version to me by
email.

Also, if your lab has moved since you first submitted a lab plan, please
submit a new lab plan for your new space to me by email.

Thank you for your teamwork on this issue, as we all strive to keep ourselves
and each other safe and healthy.

Best wishes,

**Claudia K. Gunsch, Ph.D.**  
Associate Dean, Pratt School of Engineering, Research and Infrastructure  
Theodore S. Kennedy Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering
