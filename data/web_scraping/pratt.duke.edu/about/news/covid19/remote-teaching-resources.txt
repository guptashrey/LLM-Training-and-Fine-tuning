# Remote Teaching Resources for Pratt Faculty

## What You Need to Know

Delivering courses and seminars online during the Spring 2020 term

The information below is provided to assist Duke Engineering faculty in
delivering courses and seminars online to provide instructional continuity
during the Spring 2020 term, in alignment with university policies related to
the prevention of COVID-19.

  * Recommendations for Duke Engineering Faculty
  * Teaching Resources & Support
  * Faculty Course Readiness Checklist

## Recommended Approach for Faculty

To support Duke's fully remote teaching requirement, faculty can use two core
tools—Zoom and Sakai—to:

  * Host synchronous (live) classes via the Zoom video-conferencing platform
    at the current day/time
  * Record all class sessions via Zoom for asynchronous access/availability
    for review
  * Record asynchronous classes or content via Zoom
  * Share course materials and collect assignments via a Sakai course site, if
    you aren’t doing so already
  * Conduct asynchronous discussions via Sakai forums
  * Integrate Zoom and Sakai to centralize access to class sessions and
    simplify the management of links to the recordings
  * Deliver examinations online using the Sakai Tests & Quizzes tool
  * Host office hours through Zoom

Sakai Basics

##### Note: _If you are already delivering your course online and have access
to systems/tools that will work for you, please feel free to continue in the
same manner. Think about how you can use the Zoom platform to support live
course interaction._

## Faculty Course Readiness Checklist

Steps you can take to prepare in advance of Duke University’s transition to
online course delivery on March 23:

  * Complete the Duke Engineering Faculty Readiness Survey (optional)
  * **** Login to your Duke Zoom account to confirm access if you haven’t
    already done so
  * Review the Keep Teaching @ Duke website for online teaching best
    practices; this is a dynamic resource that will be updated regularly, so
    check often.
  * Review your syllabus and develop a plan for completion of your course
  * Test the Zoom platform to make sure that you can schedule, start and
    record your sessions
  * Explore advanced Zoom features (e.g. chat, polls, breakout rooms,
    transcripts, Sakai integration, etc.) to determine what will best meet
    your needs
  * Communicate with your students in advance to share instructions and
    outline expectations as required to resume classes during the week of
    March 23
