# Duke Engineering Professor Wins International Teaching Award

November 26, 2018

The IEEE Undergraduate Teaching Award honors a single individual’s
inspirational teaching of undergraduate students

Duke Engineering faculty member Lisa Gresham Huettel has won the 2019 IEEE
Undergraduate Teaching Award. This international award, given yearly since
1990, honors a single individual’s inspirational teaching of undergraduate
students in IEEE’s fields of interest, including electrical and computer
sciences, engineering, and related disciplines.

Huettel, a professor of the practice and director of undergraduate studies in
the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE), was selected as
this year’s award recipient “for leadership in curriculum development as well
as teaching and mentoring of undergraduate students in electrical and computer
engineering,” according to IEEE.

“Our signature curriculum aims to immerse students in hands-on engineering
from day one, and Dr. Huettel has been instrumental in shaping that unique
experience for our students, ” said Krishnendu Chakrabarty, the William H.
Younger Distinguished Professor and chair of ECE. “The results have been
nothing short of transformative. The students are more confident, more
engaged, and better prepared for real-world engineering challenges than ever
before. We are pleased and proud that her excellence in teaching has been
recognized through this very significant award.”

The award, announced earlier this year, will be presented at the 2019 IEEE
Frontiers in Education Conference in October 2019.

Watch the short video above to learn more about Huettel's unique approach to
fostering engagement with engineering.
