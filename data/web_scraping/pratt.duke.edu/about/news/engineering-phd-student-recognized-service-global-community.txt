University Service Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Global
Community.

Doctoral student Titilayo Shodiya has received the William J. Griffith
University Service Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Global
Community.

The award is given annually by Duke’s UCAE Center for Leadership Development
and Social Action to a select number of graduating students whose service and
contributions to the Duke community and beyond have significantly affected the
university.

Shodiya will graduate in May with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and
materials science. She earned an M.S. in electrical and computer engineering
from Duke in 2012 and a B.S. in materials science and engineering from Penn
State in 2010. She has accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of
Michigan.

Shodiya was a recipient of the 2014 Dean’s Award for Excellence in Mentoring
from The Graduate School. During her time at Duke, she has been heavily
involved in the recruitment and development of future STEM graduate students
at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels. Her service to the
university and global communities has included

  * creating a workshop to help fellow engineering Ph.D. students prepare for
    their qualifying and preliminary exams;
  * serving as director of outreach for the Materials Science Research
    Society, which aims to build a global community of materials researchers
    to advance technical excellence;
  * serving as a convention leader at the National Society of Black Engineers
    to help increase diversity in The Graduate School and the Pratt School of
    Engineering;
  * serving on the executive board of the Alexander Bouchet Society, which
    supports underrepresented graduate students in science research and
    promotes inclusion in the sciences for all students; and
  * serving as founder and head of Project Y.E.S. Academy Inc. (Y.E.S. stands
    for youth in engineering and sciences), a nonprofit that collaborates with
    elementary, middle, and high schools in Hillsborough, North Carolina;
    Berkley, California; and the Washington DC metro area to increase the
    pipeline of students entering STEM fields.

outrageously ambitious
