Learning models capable of handling the large datasets collected in the
financial world can often become black boxes expensive to run. The quantum
computing paradigm suggests new optimization techniques, combined with
classical algorithms, may deliver competitive, faster and more interpretable
models. Lucas Leclerc, Research and Development Engineer at PASQAL, and his
team of fellow researchers proposes a quantum-enhanced machine learning
solution for the prediction of credit rating downgrades, also known as fallen-
angels forecasting in the financial risk management field. Leclerc and team
implement this solution on a neutral atom Quantum Processing Unit with up to
60 qubits on a real-life dataset. They report competitive performances against
the state-of-the-art Random Forest Benchmark with their model achieving better
interpretability and comparable training times. Leclerc and team examine how
to improve performance in the near-term, validating their ideas with Tensor
Networks-based numerical simulations.
