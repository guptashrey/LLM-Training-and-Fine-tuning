# Lessons on Flying Straight from Drosophila Melanogaster

Mar 6

_This event has passed._

##

Monday, March 6, 2023 - 9:00am to 10:00am

## Presenter

Emily Palmer

To maintain controlled flight, animals and aerial vehicles alike must execute
continuous trimming adjustments to compensate for internal and external
perturbations. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster enables studies of flight
control in biological systems; in addition to elegantly handling impending
collisions or sudden gusts, Drosophila are robust to remarkably large
asymmetries in body morphology-even after having lost half a wing, flies
retain the ability to fly straight. This performance is all the more
impressive considering that the controller responsible (i.e., the fly's brain)
is smaller than a sesame seed. In this talk, I will present findings
illuminating the neural implementation of the algorithms governing flight
control in Drosophila. By synergizing modern techniques in neuroscience and
engineering, we reveal the precise function of a population of neurons
involved in visually-mediated flight stabilization. The principles distilled
from this study have applications across disciplines, including the
inspiration for sparse control concepts for aerodynamic systems.

outrageously ambitious
