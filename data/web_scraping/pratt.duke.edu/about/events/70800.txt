# BioE Seminar Series: Lipid Nanoparticles for Overcoming Biological Barriers
to RNA Delivery

Mar 30

_This event has passed._

##

Thursday, March 30, 2023 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm

## Presenter

Michael Mitchell, PhD, Assistant Professor, Department of Bioengineering,
University of Pennsylvania

Recent years have witnessed tremendous developments and breakthroughs in the
field of RNAbased therapeutics and vaccines. The distinct mechanisms of
exogenous RNAs and analogs, including messenger RNAs, small interfering RNAs,
microRNAs, and antisense oligonucleotides, have brought them unprecedented
potential to treat a variety of pathological conditions. However, the
widespread application of RNA therapeutics and vaccines is hampered by their
intrinsic features (e.g., instability, large size, and dense negative charge)
and formidable host barriers. Development of safe and efficient vectors is key
for successful delivery and translation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines. In
this talk, I will discuss our efforts towards the development of new lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs) that enable the delivery of RNA therapeutics and vaccines
to target cells and tissues in vivo. Furthermore, I will describe new
therapeutic strategies utilizing these LNPs including (i) mRNA delivery to
bone for regenerative medicine applications, (ii) in vivo reprogramming of
immune cells for cancer immunotherapy, and (ii) in utero mRNA delivery for
treating disease before birth.
