Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) may capture the properties and
functions of materials better than previous theoretical/computational methods
because it targets correlations and does not assume an underlying physical
model. However, the statistical analysis and interpretation require careful
attention. In this talk I will discuss recently developed, explainable AI
methods [1,2] and applications [3-5] that combine detailed, consistent
experimental data (called "clean data") with theoretical data for the
identification of "rules" that determine the properties and functions of
materials. These "rules" depend on descriptive parameters, called "materials
genes". In analogy to genes in biology they are correlated with a certain
material property or function. Thus, these materials genes help the
identification of materials that are, for example, better electrical
conductors or better heat insulators or better catalysts. (*) Work done in
