Conference 2023

Mar 30

_This event has passed._

##

Thursday, March 30, 2023 to Friday, March 31, 2023

Join Duke Engineering's Institute of Enterprise Engineering and the FBI
Association of Intelligence Analysts in Washington, DC, for a two-day
conference on the latest issues in cybersecurity and financial technology. For
students, the conference will be like an extended survey course in
Cybersecurity and FinTech, with conversations from leading practitioners in
areas including ransomware, APTs, threat intelligence best practices, law
enforcement & private sector cooperation, insider threat investigations and
cybersecurity policy and law. For current practitioners, this is an excellent
opportunity to network and hear from subject matter experts on emerging
trends, threats, and best practices. The FBI Association of Intelligence
Analysts (AIA) is a nonprofit founded to advance the careers of public and
private sector intelligence analysts through mentoring, networking, and
advocacy. The Duke Master of Engineering in Cybersecurity is a high-impact
professional graduate degree program of Duke Engineering's Institute of
Enterprise Engineering. More: https://ene.duke.edu
