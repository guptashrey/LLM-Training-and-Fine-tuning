## Presenter

Ovijit Chaudhuri, PhD, Associate Professor, Departments of Mechanical
Engineering, and Bioengineering, Stanford University

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex assembly of structural proteins
that provides physical support and biochemical signaling to cells in tissues.
Over the last two decades, studies have revealed the important role that ECM
elasticity plays in regulating a variety of biological processes in cells,
including stem cell differentiation and cancer progression. However, tissues
and ECM are often viscoelastic, displaying stress relaxation over time in
response to a deformation, and viscoplastic, exhibiting irreversible
deformations in response to mechanical stress. In this talk, I will discuss
our recent findings on how matrix viscoelasticity regulates various biological
processes, including collective invasion by cancer cells and the morphogenesis
of pluripotent stem cells.
