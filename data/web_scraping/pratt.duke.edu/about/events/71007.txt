# Parametric controls and modular quantum computing in superconducting quantum
circuits

Mar 31

_This event has passed._

##

Friday, March 31, 2023 - 2:00pm to 3:00pm

## Presenter

Michael Hatridge

New attendees sign up to receive weekly invite. Use event URL. Parametric
driving has long been used in weakly nonlinear superconducting circuits to
create nearly quantum-limited 'parametric' amplifiers, which are in wide use
for the readout of superconducting qubits. However, the off-resonant terms we
can activate with parametric driving are ubiquitous in Josephson-junction
based circuits. In this talk, I'll review the basics of how we identify and
engineer parametric controls in the laboratory and use them in a variety of
applications including qubit bath engineering and single- and multi-qubit
gates. I will focus on how we are using parametric controls based on the third
order nonlinearity of SNAILs to create all-to-all couplings among transmon
qubits in small quantum modules, as well as construct quantum state routers to
link these modules into large-scale quantum machines.

outrageously ambitious
