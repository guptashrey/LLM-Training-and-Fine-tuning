# AI Health virtual seminar: Design and Implementation of a Novel Platform for

## Presenter

Andrew Olson, MPP; Associate Director, Policy Strategy and Solutions for
Health Data Science, Duke AI Health

In July, 2020, just a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC funded
the Snowball study to test an approach for more efficiently identifying and
contacting people in Durham, NC who may be at risk of infection. The study
deployed respondent-driven sampling methods, in which individuals infected
with COVID-19 serve as seed cases and recruit their own social contacts for
testing and enrollment in the study. To operationalize this approach, we built
a cloud-based platform that integrates with the Duke Health electronic health
record for case ascertainment and with the Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) application for electronic consent and collection of a social contact
survey. The platform generates unique coupons that participants validate to
enroll in the study and that are used to track all of the links between seeds
and multiple waves of peer participants. The Snowball study tested novel
methods of contact tracing as well as conducting clinical research and in this
seminar we will describe the design of the platform and share results from the
study. Please join us for this afternoon virtual seminar. The presentation
will be accessible to a broad audience, including those with no prior
background in health data science or artificial intelligence.
