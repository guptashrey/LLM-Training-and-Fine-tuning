#  Game Design, Development & Innovation Master of Engineering

## A New Way to Level Up

There are many roles to play in the game industry.

At Duke, we prepare our graduates to play the game they choose by becoming
game designers, developers, and leaders of dynamic production teams.

We will empower you with the skills industry leaders are looking for, such as
proficiency in programming—including C# and C++—and how to apply these skills
to the leading game engines. You will also learn design principles for
gameplay, art, user experience and storytelling.

Our faculty takes innovation seriously. While at Duke, our students bring
elements of game design to critical areas such as health care, education and
training simulations. With campus connections to top programs in medicine, the
humanities, business, policy and more, we go beyond gaming.

Regardless of your skill set, we will help you level up to a multi-skilled
leader and take control of your career in the game industry.
